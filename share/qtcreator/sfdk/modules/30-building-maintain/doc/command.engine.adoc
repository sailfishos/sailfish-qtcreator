The 'start' and 'stop' commands allow to control the build engine virtual machine conveniently. Starting the build engine explicitly is usually not required - commands that need build engine running will ensure it is running. The 'status' command prints status information.

Build engine properties can be set with the 'set' command and queried with the 'show' command. Known properties are described further below.

The 'exec' command allows executing an arbitrary <command> inside the build engine. If no <command> is specified, an interactive shell is executed. The '-t' option follows the semantics of the '-t' option of ssh(1).


Build engine properties:

environment.filter [<pattern>...]::
+
--
Build environment is isolated from host environment. Just those environment variables that match any <pattern> will be forwarded from host to the build environment. Pattern matching is possible with the "*" (asterisk) character. Multiple patterns may be set using whitespace as a separator.
--

host-name <name>::
+
--
Host name of the build host is recorded in metadata of the build results. The <name> should be a conformant host name, though not necessarily resolvable or globally unique one. Defaults to the host name of the host where sfdk is running.

Setting an empty <name> has the effect of taking the default value into use. (Subsequent 'show' will not report an empty value, the effective value is always reported.) The default value may vary between sfdk executions e.g. in dependence of active network connections. It is adviceable to avoid unwanted changes by setting this property explicitly where this applies.
--

vm.cpu-count <number>::
+
--
The number of virtual CPUs inside the build engine virtual machine. The maximum is limited by the number of CPUs available on the host.
--

vm.memory-size <megabytes>::
+
--
The amount of memory (RAM) available to the build engine virtual machine. The maximum is limited by the size of the physical memory available on the host.
--

vm.storage-size <megabytes>::
+
--
The amount of storage (disk) space available to the build engine virtual machine. Storage size can only grow; shrinking is not possible.
--

vm.swap-size <megabytes>::
+
--
The size of swap. Setting to zero disables swap (default). Swap may consume the free storage size inside the virtual machine. If the requested size cannot be served, the highest possible size will be set instead.
