Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %build section of the RPM SPEC file, suppressing any command figuring in that section, that is recognized as a command to generate project buildsystem. The following is a complete list of such commands:

- any 'qmake' invocation
- any 'cmake' invocation using the corresponding execution form

For CMake based projects that use 'make' as the build tool (usual), the following two commands should yield the same results:

    make <make-extra-arg>...
    cmake --build . -- <make-extra-arg>...
