Run rpmbuild. Execute all sections of the RPM SPEC file except for %prep unless told otherwise.

If path to a <project-dir-or-file> is passed, shadow build will be done. Otherwise the current working directory is treated as the project directory. (The file name part is ignored - project file selection is done by qmake call inside the RPM SPEC file.)
