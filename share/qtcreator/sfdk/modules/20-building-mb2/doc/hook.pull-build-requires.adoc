This hook is invoked by commands that take care of updating build time dependencies. This hook fully overrides the default procedure of updating build time dependencies.

Any <dependency> determined by querying the RPM SPEC file will be passed as an argument to this hook.

The following environment variables provide additional information to this hook:

SFDK_OUTPUT_DIR::
+
--
The effective output directory, possibly influenced by the 'output-dir' or 'output-prefix' configuration options.
--

SFDK_OUTPUT_DIR_FILTERED::
+
--
Only set when the 'search-output-dir' configuration option is active.  This points to a copy of the output directory with the RPM binaries built from the current project excluded.
--

SFDK_TARGET::
+
--
The active build target. Unless the 'no-snapshot' configuration option is used, this is the snapshot target name and the original build target name is available as 'SFDK_TARGET_ORIGINAL'.
--

SFDK_TARGET_ORIGINAL::
+
--
See 'SFDK_TARGET'.
--

SFDK_SPEC_FILE::
+
--
The RPM SPEC file used for this build.
