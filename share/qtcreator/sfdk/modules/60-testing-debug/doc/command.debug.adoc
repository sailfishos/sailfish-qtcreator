Conveniently invoke GDB to debug the project (build tree) under the current working directory, using the configured device (see the 'device' configuration option).

Usually, the 'start', 'attach' and 'load-core' subcommand selection can be deduced from the remaining arguments and does not need to be done explicitly - that style of invocation resembles basic GDB usage.

This command requires that all options are ordered before any positional arguments.

The 'start' command starts a new process using the <executable> on the device and attaches to it. The working directory defaults to the user home directory on the device and may be changed with the '--working-directory' option. If the '--args' option is used, all arguments following <executable> will be passed as arguments to the debugged process.

The 'attach' command attaches to an existing process created from the <executable> and identified by the <pid> on the device.

The 'load-core' command invoked GDB in the post-mortem debugging mode, using the <executable> on the device and <core-file> either on the device or on host depending on the presence of the '--local-core' option.

Additional options common to the 'start', 'attach' and 'load-core' commands:

--dry-run::
+
--
Suppress normal execution. Instead, print the commands that would be used to run gdbserver and GDB.
--

--gdb <executable>::
+
--
Use an alternative GDB <executable>.
--

--gdb-args <args>::
+
--
Pass additional arguments to GDB. Use '--dry-run' to inspect the default GDB arguments.
--

--gdbserver <executable>::
+
--
Use an alternative gdbserver <executable>.
--

--gdbserver-args <args>::
+
--
Pass additional arguments to gdbserver. Use '--dry-run' to inspect the default gdbserver arguments.
