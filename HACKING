For instructions on how to set up the Qt Creator repository to contribute
patches back to Qt Creator, please check:

Qt Creator has integrated auto tests, and further external tests in the
subdirectory 'tests'.

To build the integrated auto tests, build Qt Creator with the additional
QMake option TEST=1

To build also the auto tests, manual tests and unit tests in the 'tests'
subdirectory, use the QMake option BUILD_TESTS=1

Afterwards:

* The tests from the 'tests' subdirectory can be run as individual applications.
  They are also available as separate Run configuration from within Qt Creator.

* All the integrated tests for a specific plugin can be run with:

 qtcreator -test QtSupport

* To run only a specific test case, use:

 qtcreator -test QtSupport,testQtOutputFormatter

Note: Adding -test to Qt Creator will run the tests in a clean settingspath.
To run them with specific settings, -settingspath /path has to be provided.
