IDE Overview

Qt Creator is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides you
with tools to design and develop applications with the Qt application framework.
Qt is designed for developing applications and user interfaces once and
deploying them to several desktop, embedded, and mobile operating systems or web
browsers (experimental). Qt Creator provides you with tools for accomplishing
your tasks throughout the whole application development life-cycle, from
creating a project to deploying the application to the target platforms.
