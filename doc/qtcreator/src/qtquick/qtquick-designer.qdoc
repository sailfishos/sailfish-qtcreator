    \title Design Views

    \QDS contains views for designing UIs. To open them, select
    \uicontrol View > \uicontrol Views. The following images present the
    views that you are likely to use most often while designing UIs.

    \image studio-design-mode.png "Design views"
    \image studio-design-mode-states-timeline.png "The States and Timeline views"

    You can move the views anywhere on the screen and save them as
    \e workspaces, as instructed in \l {Managing Workspaces}.

    To learn more about using the design views, see the following video:
