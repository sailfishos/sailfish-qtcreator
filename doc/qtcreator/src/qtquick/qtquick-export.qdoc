    \title Exporting QML

    \l{Qt Quick UI Forms}{UI forms} (ui.qml files) can be exported to
    JSON metadata format and PNG assets.

    To export the \l{Qt Quick UI Forms}{UI forms} (ui.qml files) from the
    current project, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Export QML}.

    The primary use of exported metadata and assets is to generate native file
    formats in content creation tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, using \QB. \QBPS
    can generate PSD files by importing the metadata and assets.

    QML is exported as follows:

    \list
        \li QML types inherited from \l [QML]{Item}{Item} are exported, other
            types are ignored.
        \li \l [QML]{Text}{Text} components are exported as metadata only
            and no assets are generated.
        \li \l [QML]{Rectangle}{Rectangle} and \l [QML]{Image}{Image} types
            generate assets as PNG files.
    \endlist

    \section1 Configuring QML Export

    You can configure the export in the \uicontrol {Export QML} dialog, which
    lists the \l{Qt Quick UI Forms}{UI forms} (ui.qml files) of the current
    project.

    \list 1
        \li In the \uicontrol {Export path} field, specify the path where
            the metadata file and assets are exported.
        \li Deselect the \uicontrol {Export assets} check box to disable
            exporting assets and only generate the metadata file.
        \li In the file list, select the \l{Qt Quick UI Forms}{UI forms}
            to be exported.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Export} export to start the export process.
    \endlist
