    \title Annotating Designs

    You can submit your designs to review or further development as QML files.
    You can annotate your designs to provide reviewers or developers with
    additional information about them. You can add \e {global annotations}
    that apply to the whole file or annotate individual components.

    An annotation consist of an annotation name and one or several comments.
    The comments have a title, author, and comment text.

    To add or edit global annotations, select \inlineimage icons/annotation.png
    on the top menu bar in the Design mode.

    Global annotations have an additional status property, which enables you
    to indicate whether you are still working on the design, you have submitted
    it to review, or it can be considered done. To set the status, select
    \uicontrol {Add Status}.

    Annotations are saved in the end of QML files when you save the file. They
    do not affect the QML performance in any way.
