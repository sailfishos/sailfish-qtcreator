    \title Using Custom Fonts

    For your UI to use custom fonts when you preview it on a device,
    you have to import the fonts to the project folder. \QDS deploys them to
    the device along with your UI.

    \note Use fixed-width fonts if you plan to animate running numbers, so that
    they do not appear to jump around the screen when they change.

    To add fonts:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol Assets >
            \uicontrol {Add New Assets}.
        \li Browse to the folder that contains the font files and select them.
        \li Enter the name of the directory to save the fonts. By default, \QDS
            suggests the project directory.
        \li Select \uicontrol OK to save the fonts.
    \endlist

    The fonts are added to the list of fonts for the \uicontrol Font property
    in \uicontrol Properties.
