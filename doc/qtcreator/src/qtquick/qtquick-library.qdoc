    \title Library

    The \uicontrol Library view lists the available components and assets.

    \section1 Components

    \image qtquick-components-tab.png "Library view Components tab"

    \uicontrol Components displays modules that have been added to your project.
    In many modules the components have been further organized into different
    categories. The modules contain visual components, such as basic shapes,
    UI controls, and 3D components, and add functionality to the project.
    All components have a type.

    The UI controls can be styled to have the look and feel of a particular
    operating system, such as \macOS, Windows, Android, or iOS.

    Some modules have no visible components. For example, the
    \uicontrol {Qt.Multimedia} module adds support for audio and video
    files to your UI.

    \section2 Component Types

    You can add the following types of components to your project:

    \list
        \li \l Shapes
        \li \l Text
        \li \l Images
        \li \l {User Interaction Methods}
        \li \l {Lists and Other Data Models}
        \if defined(qtdesignstudio)
        \li \l {2D Effects}
        \li \l {Logic Helpers}
        \endif
        \li \l Animations
        \li \l{Using 3D Components}{3D Components}
    \endlist

    For more information about creating your own components, see
    \l{Creating Components}.

    \section2 Adding and Removing Modules

    When you \l{Creating Projects}{create projects}, modules typically needed in
    them are added by default. For example, an empty application project
    contains basic components and UI controls, while a 3D application project
    contains additional 3D components.

    To view the list of available modules, select \inlineimage plus.png
    . Most commonly used modules are placed at the top of the list in
    alphabetical order. You can search for components and modules by entering
    search criteria in the \uicontrol Search field.

    Select the module to add it to \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol Components.

    \image qtquick-components-tab-add.png "Select Modules to Add"

    This adds an \e {import statement} to the component code that you
    can see in \l {Text Editor}. For example, if you add the
    \uicontrol QtQuick.Controls module, the following import statement
    is added to the code: \c {import QtQuick.Controls}.

    Since the added components and modules are packaged with your UI into the
    final application package, it is recommended that you select
    \uicontrol {Remove Module} to remove the ones you don't use in the project.

    \section1 Assets

    \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol {Assets} displays the images and other files
    that you add to the project folder by selecting \inlineimage plus.png
    .

    \image qtquick-assets-tab.png "Library view Assets tab"

    When you drag-and-drop assets from \uicontrol Assets to \l Navigator
    or \l {Form Editor}, component instances with a suitable type are
    automatically created for you. For example, instances of the
    \l{Images}{Image} component will be created for graphics files.

    \section1 Context Menu Commands

    \image qtquick-library-context-menu.png "Context menu commands in Library"
    \image qtquick-library-context-menu-hide.png "Context menu command Hide Category"

    To use the context menu commands in Library, right-click on the name of
    a module or category and select one of the following commands:

    \list
        \li \uicontrol {Remove Module}: removes the component module added to
            \uicontrol Library.
        \li \uicontrol {Expand All}: expands all the modules.
        \li \uicontrol {Collapse All}: collapses all the modules.
        \li \uicontrol {Hide Category}: hides the category from the module.
        \li \uicontrol {Show Module Hidden Categories}: shows the hidden
            categories of the module.
        \li \uicontrol {Show All Hidden Categories}: shows the hidden
            categories in all of the modules.
    \endlist
