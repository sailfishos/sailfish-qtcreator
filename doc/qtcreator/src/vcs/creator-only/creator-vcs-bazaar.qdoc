    \title Using Bazaar

    Bazaar is a free version control system sponsored by Canonical.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Using Common Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Bazaar > \uicontrol Pull to turn a branch into a mirror of
    another branch. To update the mirror of the branch, select \uicontrol Push.

    \section1 Uncommitting Revisions

    In Bazaar, committing changes to a branch creates a new revision that holds
    a snapshot of the state of the working tree. To remove the last committed
    revision, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Bazaar > \uicontrol Uncommit.

    In the \uicontrol Uncommit dialog, select options to keep tags that point to
    removed revisions and to only remove the commits from the local branch when
    in a checkout.

    To remove all commits up to an entry in the revision log, specify the
    revision in the \uicontrol Revision field.

    To test the outcome of the \uicontrol Uncommit command without actually
    removing anything, select \uicontrol {Dry Run}.

    \uicontrol Uncommit leaves the working tree ready for a new commit. The only
    change it might make is restoring pending merges that were present before
    the commit.
