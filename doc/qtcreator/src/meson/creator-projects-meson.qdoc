    \title Setting Up Meson

    \l{https://mesonbuild.com/}{Meson} is an open source and multi-platform build
    system generator using Ninja as main backend. Build definitions are located
    in \c {meson.build} files while build options are located in
    \c {meson_options.txt}.

    Meson build support in \QC is not mature yet, you can only use it to build
    native desktop applications. Many features available with Meson build or
    usually available from \QC are missing.

    \QC automatically detects the Meson and Ninja executables specified in the
    \c PATH. You can add paths to other Meson or Ninja executables and use them
    in different build and run \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits}.

    \note Meson build plugin is disabled by default, see
    \l{Enabling and Disabling Plugins}.

    \section1 Adding Meson Tools

    \QC does not have strong requirements on Meson build's version, any version
    above 0.49.0 should be compatible.

    To specify paths to Meson or Ninja executables:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Meson >
            \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Add.

            \image qtcreator-mesonexecutable.png

        \li In the \uicontrol Name field, specify a name for the tool.

        \li In the \uicontrol Path field, specify the path to the Meson or Ninja
            executable.

        \li Select \uicontrol Apply to save your changes.

    \endlist

    Select the
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits > \uicontrol Kits
    tab to add the Meson and Ninja tools to a build and run kit:

    For more information, see \l {Adding Kits}.

    \section1 Editing Meson Build Descriptions

    To open a meson.build file for editing, double-click it from project tree.
    Only plain text editor is available now.


   \section1 Code Completion and External Libraries

    Through external libraries, \QC can support code completion and syntax
    highlighting as if they were part of the current project or the Qt library.

    \QC handles code completion from compilation flags in Meson introspection
    data. Any external library added with \c {dependency()} or found in include
    path will be known by \QC for code completion.

    Syntax completion and highlighting work once your project configures successfully.

    \section1 Current Meson Support Limitations

    The following features are not supported yet:

    \list
        \li Cross compilation.
        \li Showing header files in project tree.
        \li Configuration change detection, for example when building triggers a
        Meson configuration first.
        \li Actions from locator such as searching or triggering builds.
        \li Adding files to Meson projects from \QC.
    \endlist
