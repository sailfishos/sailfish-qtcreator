    \title Meson Build Configuration

    \image qtcreator-meson-build-settings.png

    Settings are grouped by category by Meson. All items are user modifiable
    except \c backend which is forced to Ninja, \c {buildtype}, \c debug as well
    as \c optimization to ensure a good compatibility with \QC.

    Each setting type has its own editor. To modif any setting, double-click it,
    either edit the field, or select your choice depending on the control. To
    apply changes, select \uicontrol {Apply configuration changes}. This will
    trigger a \c {meson configure} command if there were any configuration
    changes. If for any reason the build directory configuration is broken,
    select \uicontrol {Wipe project}. This should fix any build directory.

    \note Any modified setting will remain in bold until \uicontrol
    {Apply configuration changes} is selected.

    \section1 Meson Build Steps

    \QC builds Meson projects by running \c {ninja -v target}.

    You can add arguments and targets for the build command in
    \uicontrol {Build Steps}.

    The build errors and warnings are parsed and displayed in the
    \uicontrol Issues output pane.

    \section1 Meson Clean Steps

    When building with Meson, you can add arguments and targets for the clean
    command in \uicontrol {Clean Steps}.

    The build errors and warnings are parsed and displayed in the
    \uicontrol Issues output pane.
