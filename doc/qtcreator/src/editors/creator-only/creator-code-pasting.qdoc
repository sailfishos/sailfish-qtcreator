    \title Pasting and Fetching Code Snippets

    In \QC, you can paste snippets of code to a server or fetch snippets of
    code from the server. To paste and fetch snippets of code, \QC uses the
    following:

    \list
        \li \uicontrol {Pastebin.Com}
        \li \uicontrol {Pastecode.Xyz}
        \li \uicontrol {Shared network drives}
    \endlist

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Code Pasting

    To specify settings for the code pasting service:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options  >
            \uicontrol {Code Pasting}.
            \image qtcreator-code-pasting-options.png "Code Pasting options"
        \li In the \uicontrol {Default protocol} field, select a code pasting
            service to use by default.
        \li In the \uicontrol Username field, enter your username.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Expires after} field, specify the time to keep
            the pasted snippet on the server.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Copy-paste URL to clipboard} check box to
            copy the URL of the post on the code pasting service to the
            clipboard when you paste a post.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Display Output pane after sending a post}
            check box to display the URL in the \uicontrol {General Messages}
            output pane when you paste a post.
    \endlist

    Select \uicontrol Fileshare to specify the path to a shared network drive.
    The code snippets are copied to the drive as simple files. You have to
    delete obsolete files from the drive manually.

    \section1 Using Code Pasting Services

    To paste a snippet of code onto the server, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Paste Snippet} or press
    \key {Alt+C,Alt+P}. By default, \QC copies the URL of the snippet to the
    clipboard and displays the URL in the \uicontrol {General Messages} output
    pane.

    To paste any content that you copied to the clipboard, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Paste Snippet}.

    To paste content from the \l{Comparing Files}{diff editor}, right-click a
    chunk and select \uicontrol {Send Chunk to CodePaster} in the context menu.

    To fetch a snippet of code from the server, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Fetch Snippet} or press
    \key {Alt+C,Alt+F}. Select the snippet to fetch from the list.

    To fetch the content stored at an URL, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Fetch from URL}.

    For example, you might ask colleagues to review a change that you plan to
    submit to a version control system. If you use the Git version control
    system, you can create a \e{diff} view by selecting \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol Diff. You can
    then upload its contents to the server by selecting \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Paste Snippet}. The reviewers can
    retrieve the code snippet by selecting \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol {Code Pasting} > \uicontrol {Fetch Snippet}. If they have the
    project currently opened in \QC, they can apply and test the change by
    choosing \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository}
    > \uicontrol Patch > \uicontrol {Apply from Editor}.
