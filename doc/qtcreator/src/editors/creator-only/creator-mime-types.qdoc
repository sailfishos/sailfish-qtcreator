    \title Editing MIME Types

    \QC uses the \l{https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml}
    {MIME type} of the file to determine which mode and editor to use for
    opening the file. For example, \QC opens C++ source and header files in
    the C++ editor, and Qt widget based UI files (.ui) in \QD.
    For some MIME types, you can change the editor that is used to open the
    files of that type by default.

    To identify the MIME type of a file, \QC uses matching by pattern and
    matching by contents. First, \QC looks at the filename to check whether it
    matches the patterns specified for any MIME type. If no match is found, it
    checks the contents of the file for magic headers specified for the file.

    The magic headers can contain the following types of values: string, host,
    big-endian, little-endian, and byte. \QC interprets the values according to
    the
    \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-latest.html}
    {Shared MIME-info Database specification}.

    \QC searches for the value within a specified range in the files and takes
    the priority of the magic header into account. If you specify wide search
    ranges, openging files in \QC might take a long time. Therefore, you are
    advised to use the recommended values for the range and priority of the
    magic header.

    If your files do not match the predefined MIME types, you can edit the
    MIME types to add filename extensions and magic headers. You cannot add
    new MIME types, however.

    To edit MIME types:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
            \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol {MIME Types}.

            \image qtcreator-mime-types.png "MIME Types"

        \li In \uicontrol {MIME Type}, select a MIME type.

        \li In \uicontrol Patterns, add the filename extension for the type of files
            that you want to identify as having this MIME type.

        \li Click \uicontrol Add to add \uicontrol {Magic Headers}.

            \image qtcreator-mime-types-magic-header.png "Magic Header"

        \li In the \uicontrol Value field, specify a text string or bytes that
            appear in the files.

        \li In the \uicontrol Type field, select the type of the value.

        \li In the \uicontrol Mask field, specify the number to combine the
            value in the file with using the AND operator before comparing it to
            the specified value. You can specify any numbers as masks for
            numerical types, whereas masks for strings must be in base 16, and
            start with 0x.

            \note You are recommended not to change the range and priority,
            because it might cause problems when opening files in \QC.

        \li In \uicontrol Handler, double-click the editor name to display a
            context-menu where you can select another editor to open the file
            in by default. The menu is available only if alternative suitable
            editors are available.

        \li Click \uicontrol OK.

    \endlist

    Even if an alternative editor is not listed for a MIME type, you can still
    change the editor that is used to open the files of a particular type.
    Remove the filename extension from the current MIME type and add it to a
    MIME type that is handled by the editor you want to use. For example, to
    edit Linux kernel device tree source (.dts) files with the text editor,
    delete the pattern \c {*.dts} from the MIME type \c {audio/vnd.dts} (where
    it represents the digital surround audio file format), and add it to the
    \c {text/plain} MIME type. You can use the \uicontrol Filter field to find
    the MIME type that currently contains a filename extension.

    To revert the changes you have made to the MIME type definitions,
    select \uicontrol {Reset MIME Types}. To revert the changes you have
    made to the default editors, select \uicontrol {Reset Handlers}.

    \note If you now select \uicontrol OK or \uicontrol Apply, you permanently lose all
    your own patterns and magic headers. The changes are reverted the next
    time you start \QC.
