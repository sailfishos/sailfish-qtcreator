    \title Managing Workspaces

    In the Design and Debug modes, you can arrange a set of \QC
    views as a \e workspace on the screen.

    To detach views:

    \list
        \li Double-click the title bar of the view.
        \li Start dragging the view to another position.
        \li Select the \inlineimage icons/detach-group-icon.png
            (\uicontrol {Detach Group}) button.
    \endlist

    You can move detached views or groups of views anywhere on the screen.

    To attach views, drag them over the dock area markers until the dock area
    where you want to attach the view is highlighted, and then drop them into
    the dock area.
