    \title Managing Data Collection

    \if defined (qtcreator)
    When you install \QC as a part of Qt installation, you are asked whether
    you allow it to collect pseudonymous information about your system and \QC
    use. If you decline, the plugin is not installed and no analytics data is
    collected.

    If you accept, all collected and transmitted data is fully transparent to
    you. You can change the settings for collecting and transmitting data any
    time. By default, no data is collected and you have to select a telemetry
    mode for data collection to begin.


    See \l {Collecting Usage Statistics} for more information about the data
    transmitted by the telemetry plugin and \l {Specifying Telemetry Settings}
    {specifying telemetry settings}.
    \else
    To enable the use of the telemetry plugin, you need to select \uicontrol
    {Enable Usage Statistics} in the splash screen that appears when you first
    launch \QDS. If the splash screen does not appear, you can enable the
    telemetry plugin by selecting \uicontrol Help > \uicontrol {About Plugins} >
    \uicontrol Utilities > \uicontrol UsageStatistic.

    \endif

    \if defined(qtdesignstudio)
    See below for more information about the collected data:

    \list
        \li \l {Collecting Usage Statistics}
        \li \l {Collecting User Feedback}
        \li \l {Reporting Crashes}
    \endlist
    \endif

    \section1 Principles of Data Collection

    No personal data, such as names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, or project
    and path names are collected. However, QUuid objects are used to identify
    data records that belong to one user. The objects cannot be converted
    back to the actual values from which they were generated.

    \l{https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/#privacy}
    {Legal Notice and Privacy Policy}.

    \title Collecting Usage Statistics

    The telemetry plugin uses the
    \l{https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kuserfeedback/html/index.html}
    {KUserFeedback} framework to collect the usage data. The library
    has been designed from the user data privacy point of view and
    \QC respects the same privacy rules.

    The data is transmitted to the backend storage using an encrypted
    connection. The storage is located in the same Heroku backend as the
    Qt installer backend. Physically, data is stored in the Amazon cloud.

    \section1 Specifying Telemetry Settings

    To determine what data is transmitted to the backend storage:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Telemetry
            > \uicontrol {Usage Statistics}.
            \image qtcreator-telemetry-settings.png "Telemetry settings"
        \li In the \uicontrol {Telemetry mode} list, select the mode that
            determines what kind of data is collected.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Data sources} list, select entries to view
            exactly what data is collected. Deselect check boxes for data
            that you do not want to transmit to the backend storage.
    \endlist

    \title Collecting User Feedback

    A pop-up survey asking for your feedback will appear for some of the features
    after you have been using them for some time. You will be asked to to rate
    the usefulness of the feature on a scale of one to five stars. You must rate
    the feature with at least one star if you wish to submit your rating. You
    are also encouraged to give additional written feedback. After you select
    \uicontrol Skip or \uicontrol Submit, the pop-up survey will not appear for
    the same feature again.

    \image studio-feedback-popup.png "User feedback pop-up survey for Flow Editor"

    For the pop-up survey to appear, you must enable collecting statistics, and
    also allow collecting \uicontrol {4 - Detailed usage statistics} in
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >  \uicontrol Telemetry >
    \uicontrol {Usage Statistics} > \uicontrol {Telemetry mode}.
    You can review the submitted user feedback in
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Telemetry >
    \uicontrol {Usage Statistics} > \uicontrol {Collected Data} by selecting
    \uicontrol {Qt Quick Designer Usage of views and actions} in
    \uicontrol {Data sources}.

    \title Reporting Crashes

    You can enable \QDS to report crashes automatically. \QDS uses Google
    Crashpad to collect crashes and report them to the Sentry backend storage
    for processing. The purpose of Crashpad is to capture application state in
    sufficient detail to allow developers to diagnose and, where possible, fix
    the issue causing the crash. Crashpad may capture arbitrary contents from
    the memory of a crashed process, including user sensitive information, URLs,
    and other content provided by the users. The collected reports are used for
    the sole purpose of fixing bugs. For more information on Crashpad, see the
    \l {https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/doc/overview_design.md}
    {documentation} by Google. For more information on processing and storing
    of the collected data, see \l {https://sentry.io/security/}
    {Security & Compliance} by Sentry.

    To enable sending crash reports, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol
    Options > \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol System
    (\uicontrol {Qt Design Studio} > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol
    Environment > \uicontrol System on \macos), and then select
    \uicontrol {Enable crash reporting}.

    Since crash reports take up disk space, you may wish to remove them when
    they are no longer needed. Select \uicontrol {Clear local crash reports} to
    remove the crash report data.
