    \section2 CMake Build Configuration

    Configuring medium-sized to large CMake projects in \QC can be a
    challenge due to the number of options that you need to pass to
    CMake to configure the project correctly. \QC creates an initial
    configuration for you based on the kit settings and displays it in
    the \uicontrol {Initial CMake parameters} field.

    \image qtcreator-cmake-build-settings.png

    In the \uicontrol Value column, you can view and edit the actual values
    of the parameters that are passed to CMake. Parameter names are listed
    in the \uicontrol Key column. Names with a common prefix (up to the first
    underscore character) are grouped under the prefix. To view all parameters,
    select the \uicontrol Advanced check box.

    To add parameters, select \uicontrol Add, and then select the type of
    the parameter that you are adding: \uicontrol Boolean, \uicontrol String,
    \uicontrol Directory, or \uicontrol File.

    To change the type of the selected parameter, right-click the
    parameter name in the \uicontrol Key column, and then select
    \uicontrol {Force to bool}, \uicontrol {Force to file},
    \uicontrol {Force to directory}, or \uicontrol {Force to string}
    in the context menu.

    To modify the value of a parameter, double-click it, or select it,
    and then select \uicontrol Edit.

    You can apply actions to multiple parameters at a time. To clear
    the selection, select \uicontrol {Clear Selection}.

    To remove the selected parameters, select \uicontrol Unset. To undo
    the removal, select \uicontrol Set.

    To reset all the changes that you made, select \uicontrol Reset.

    To save the changes, select \uicontrol {Apply Configuration Changes}.
    Keep in mind that a configuration change might trigger a follow-up
    configuration change.

    The parameter values that you change are passed via \c -D<option>=<value>
    to CMake, which stores the options in the CMakeCache.txt file. This means
    that if you remove the build directory, all the custom parameters that are
    not part of the initial CMake parameters are also removed.

    To reconfigure a project after making changes to the initial parameters,
    select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Clear CMake Configuration}, which
    removes the CMakeCache.txt file. This enables you to do a full rebuild.

    \section2 CMake Build Steps

    \QC builds CMake projects by running \c {cmake . --build}, which then runs
    the CMake generator specified in the project configuration: \c make,
    \c mingw32-make, \c nmake, or \c ninja, for example. The CMake generator
    produces project files for \QC.

    You can add arguments to pass to CMake and the generator and targets for
    the build command in \uicontrol {Build Steps}.

    \note While the other CMake generators are installed together with Qt,
    you usually need to install Ninja yourself. For more information, see
    \l {Using Ninja as a CMake Generator}.

//! [cmake ninja]

    \section2 Using Ninja as a CMake Generator

    To use \l {https://ninja-build.org/}{Ninja} with CMake, you must install it
    and select it as the CMake generator in the build and run kit:

    \list 1
        \li Install Ninja.
        \li Add the path to the Ninja executable to the value of the PATH system
            variable.
        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits, and
            then select the build and run kit for the project.
        \li Select \uicontrol Change next to the \uicontrol {CMake generator}
            field to open the \uicontrol {CMake Generator} dialog.
            \image qtcreator-build-steps-cmake-ninja.png
        \li In the \uicontrol Generator field, select \uicontrol Ninja.
        \li Select \uicontrol OK to return to the \uicontrol Kits tab.
        \li Select \uicontrol OK or \uicontrol Apply to save your changes.
    \endlist

    \note To make sure that old build artifacts don't get in the way
    the first time you build the project after the change, select
    \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Rebuild Project}. This cleans up the
    build directory and performs a new build.

//! [cmake clean steps]

    \section2 CMake Clean Steps

    When building with CMake, you can add arguments to pass to CMake and the
    generator and targets for the clean command in \uicontrol {Clean Steps}.

    \image qtcreator-cmake-clean-steps.png

    The build errors and warnings are parsed and displayed in the
    \uicontrol Issues output pane.
