    \title Desktop Platforms

    \QC is available in binary packages for the following operating systems:

    \list
        \li \l Linux
        \li \l macOS
        \li \l Windows
    \endlist

    You can use \QC to build, run, debug, and analyze applications on these
    platforms.

    \section1 Linux

    (K)Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (64-bit) or later is supported.

    To build Qt applications using \QC on Linux, you usually need the
    following:

    \list
        \li g++
        \li make
        \li libglib2.0-dev
        \li libSM-dev
        \li libxrender-dev
        \li libfontconfig1-dev
        \li libxext-dev
        \li libfreetype6-dev
        \li libx11-dev
        \li libxcursor-dev
        \li libxfixes-dev
        \li libxft-dev
        \li libxi-dev
        \li libxrandr-dev
        \li libgl-dev and libglu-dev if you use Qt OpenGL (deprecated
            in Qt 5) or Qt GUI OpenGL functions
    \endlist

    \section1 macOS

    \macos 10.13 or later is supported with the Xcode tools for your \macos
    version available in the Mac App Store.

    \section1 Windows

    Windows 7 (64-bit) or later is supported.

    \note Some \QC plugins rely on Direct3D (part of DirectX). You might
    have to manually enable support for it if you are running Windows in a
    Virtual Machine. For more information, see
    \l{http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d}
    {Hardware 3D acceleration (OpenGL and Direct3D 8/9)} and
    \l{http://pubs.vmware.com/workstation-10/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.ws.using.doc%2FGUID-EA588485-718A-4FD8-81F5-B6E1F04C5788.html}
    {Prepare the Host System to Use DirectX 9 Accelerated Graphics}.

    \section1 Compiling from Source

    To build \QC from the source, see the requirements and instructions in the
    readme file that is located in the source repository.
