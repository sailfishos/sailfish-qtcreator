    \section1 Target Platforms

    You can develop applications for the following platforms:

    \list
        \li Desktop
        \li \l{Connecting Android Devices}{Android}
        \li \l{Connecting Bare Metal Devices}{Bare Metal}
        \li Boot2Qt
        \li \l{Connecting Generic Remote Linux Devices}{Generic Remote Linux}
        \li \l{Connecting iOS Devices}{iOS}
        \li \l{Connecting MCUs}{Microcontroller Units (MCU)} (commercial only)
        \li \l{Connecting QNX Devices}{QNX}
        \li \l{Qt for UWP}{Universal Windows Platform (UWP)}
        \li \l{Building Applications for the Web}{WebAssembly}
    \endlist

    \section2 Boot2Qt Devices

    The Boot2Qt stack can be made to run on a variety of hardware. For
    Qt for Device Creation license holders, tooling is provided to customize the
    contents of the stack as well as to take it into desired production
    hardware.

    For more information about the supported device groups and reference devices,
    see \l{https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtee-supported-platforms.html}
    {Reference Target Devices and Development Hosts} in the
    \l{https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/index.html}{Qt for Device Creation}
    documentation.

    \note Since \QC 4.9, only Boot2Qt version 5.9 and later are supported.
    To develop for earlier Boot2Qt versions, use \QC 4.8.

    \section2 Mobile Devices

    The following table summarizes operating system support for developing
    applications for mobile device platforms.
