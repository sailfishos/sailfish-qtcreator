        \li \b{Syntax highlighting engine for Kate syntax definitions}

            This is a stand-alone implementation of the Kate syntax highlighting engine.
            It's meant as a building block for text editors as well as for simple highlighted
            text rendering (e.g. as HTML), supporting both integration with a custom editor
            as well as a ready-to-use QSyntaxHighlighter sub-class.

        \li \b{Mesa LLVMPipe, 3D graphics library}

        Mesa is a 3D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that
        of OpenGL. The llvmpipe software renderer enables the running of OpenGL
        applications without any hardware or driver support.

        Mesa is shipped as part of the binary packages for Windows
        (opengl32sw.dll).

        \li \b{JSON Library by Niels Lohmann}

        Used by the Chrome Trace Format Visualizer plugin instead of QJson
        because of QJson's current hard limit of 128 Mb object size and
        trace files often being much larger.

        The sources can be found in
        \c QtCreator/src/libs/3rdparty/json.
