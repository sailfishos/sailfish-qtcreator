    \section1 Creating UIs for MCUs

    \l{Qt for MCUs} enables you to use subsets of QML and Qt Quick Controls
    types to create UIs for devices that are powered by microcontroller units
    (MCU). The subset of supported types depends on the Qt for MCUs version
    that you use for development. In this manual, we indicate which components
    are supported at the time of writing.

    To develop for MCUs, \l{Using Project Wizards}{create an MCU project}. Only
    the types available on MCUs are displayed in the \uicontrol {QML Types} tab
    in \uicontrol Library. Only a subset of properties is supported for the
    supported types. The properties that are not available on MCUs are marked
    in the \uicontrol Properties view by enclosing them in square brackets.

    \l{Qt for MCUs - All QML Types}.
