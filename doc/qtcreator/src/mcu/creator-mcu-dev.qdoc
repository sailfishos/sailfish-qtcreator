    \title Connecting MCUs

    Qt for MCU enables you to use subsets of QML and Qt Quick Controls
    to create user interfaces for devices that are powered by microcontroller
    units (MCU). It includes a new graphics rendering engine that has a low
    memory footprint and is optimized for MCUs and other resource-constrained
    devices.

    You can connect MCU boards to a development host to build applications for
    them using the GNU Arm Embedded GCC compiler, libraries, and other GNU tools
    necessary for bare metal software development on devices based on the Arm
    Cortex-M processors. You can deploy the applications on MCUs to run and
    debug them using \QC.

    The toolchains are available for cross-compilation on Microsoft Windows,
    Linux, and macOS. However, the Qt for MCU SDK is currently only available
    for Windows.

    For a list of Qt for MCU reference implementations, see the
    \l{Qt for MCUs - Supported Target Platforms}{Qt for MCUs} documentation.

    \section1 Requirements

    To use \QC to develop QML applications for MCUs, you need the following:

    \list
        \li Qt for MCU SDK (only available for Windows)
        \li \l{https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm}
            {GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain}
    \endlist

    The hardware-specific requirements vary depending on the hardware platform you are developing for.
    For more information see:
    \list
        \li \l{Getting Started on NXP}
        \li \l{Getting Started on STM}
        \li \l{Getting Started on Renesas}
     \endlist

    \section1 Setting Up the Development Environment

    You must download and install the required software and create connections
    between \QC and MCUs. The following subsections guide you through the
    setup process.

    \section2 MCU Plugin

    To be able to develop applications for MCUs, you need the MCU plugin.
    This plugin is enabled automatically by the Qt Installer when you
    install Qt for MCUs.

    \section2 Specifying MCU Settings

    To configure a connection between \QC and your MCU board, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Devices >
    \uicontrol MCU:

    \image qtcreator-mcu-options.png "MCU options"

    \list 1
        \li In the \uicontrol {Qt for MCUs SDK} field, specify the path
            to the directory where you installed Qt for MCUs SDK.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Targets supported by the Qt for MCUs SDK}
            field, select your MCU board.
        \li In the \uicontrol Requirements section, ensure that the
            platform-specific requirements are met. This varies depending
            on the target chosen:
            \list
                \li For STM32 targets:
                    \list
                        \li The \uicontrol {GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain} or
                            \uicontrol {IAR ARM Compiler} path.
                        \li The \uicontrol {STM32CubeProgrammer} install path.
                        \li The \uicontrol {MCU SDK} for the chosen target.
                        \li The \uicontrol {FreeRTOS Sources} for the chosen target.
                    \endlist
                 \li For NXP targets:
                    \list
                        \li The \uicontrol {GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain} or
                            \uicontrol {IAR ARM Compiler} path.
                        \li The \uicontrol {MCUXpresso IDE} install path.
                        \li The \uicontrol {MCU SDK} for the chosen target.
                        \li The \uicontrol {FreeRTOS Sources} for the chosen target.
                    \endlist
                 \li For Renesas targets:
                    \list
                        \li The \uicontrol {Green Hills Compiler} path.
                        \li The \uicontrol {Renesas Graphics Library} path.
                    \endlist
            \endlist
        \li Select the
            \uicontrol {Automatically create kits for all available targets on start}
            option to create kits automatically.
            \note You could also use \uicontrol {Create Kit} or
                 \uicontrol{Remove Kit} to manually create or remove kits for the chosen
                 target.
        \li Select \uicontrol Apply to save the settings.
    \endlist
    \note You must restart \QC if you chose to create kits automatically
          for all the available targets.

    \section2 Adding MCU Devices

    \note This optional step is not necessary if you have already
    set up the MCU SDK as outlined in \l{Specifying MCU Settings}.

    \QC automatically adds a default MCU device when you select
    \uicontrol Apply in the \uicontrol MCU tab after configuring the
    MCU tool chain.

    \image qtcreator-mcu-device.png "MCU devices"

    To add MCU devices, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol Add > \uicontrol {MCU Device} >
    \uicontrol {Start Wizard}:

       \list 1
           \li In the \uicontrol Name field, give the device a name.
           \li In the \uicontrol Type field, select the board type.
           \li Select \uicontrol Apply to add the device.
       \endlist

    \section2 Adding MCU Kits

    \note This optional step is not necessary if you have already
    set up the MCU SDK as outlined in \l{Specifying MCU Settings}.

    \QC automatically adds kits for all the available targets, if
    the
    \uicontrol {Automatically create kits for all available targets on start}
    option is enabled under the \uicontrol MCU settings tab.

    \image qtcreator-mcu-kit.png "MCU kits"

    To add kits, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits
    > \uicontrol Add:

    \list 1
        \li In the \uicontrol Name field, specify a name for the kit.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Device type} field, select
            \uicontrol {MCU}.
        \li In the \uicontrol Device field, select the MCU board for the kit.
        \li In the \uicontrol Compiler field, select the Arm GCC compiler for
            the kit.
        \li Select \uicontrol Apply to add the kit.
    \endlist

    \section1 Running Applications on MCUs

    You can use a wizard to set up a project for developing an application that
    you can run on MCUs. The project uses a subset of QML and Qt Quick Controls
    that are supported by Qt for MCU. For more information about developing
    applications for MCUs, see the Qt for MCU documentation.

    To create an application and run it on a MCU board:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol {Application (Qt for MCU)} >
            \uicontrol {MCU Support Application} > \uicontrol Choose.
        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard to create the project.
        \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run}, and then
            select the kit for building the application and running it on the
            MCU board specified in the kit.
        \li Select \uicontrol Run to specify run settings.
            Usually, you can use the default settings.
    \endlist
