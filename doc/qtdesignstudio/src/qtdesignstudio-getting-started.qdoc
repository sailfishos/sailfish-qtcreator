    \title Getting Started

    Typically, you as a designer would design a UI using imaging and design
    tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Blender, or Maya, and then send your
    design to a developer for implementation. With the \QB export tool,
    you can convert 2D assets into \l {Qt Quick} files. You can use the export
    functionality of 3D graphics tools to save your 3D assets in a format
    supported by \QDS. You can import the 2D and 3D assets into \QDS for
    editing, before you submit the UI to the developer for adding the
    functionality to the application.

    The following image describes the workflow using \QBPS and \QDS:

    The workflow consists of the following steps:

    \list 1
        \li Export your design from a design tool.
        \li Create a project in \QDS and import your design to it.
        \li Create reusable components in the Design mode.
        \li Animate your design with the transition editor or timeline and
            easing curve editor.
        \li Create interactions using states and connections.
        \li Preview your design in real time, on the desktop or on a mobile
            or an embedded device.
    \endlist

    \section1 First Steps

    The following topics contain information that you'll need to find your
    way around \QDS:

    \list
        \li \l {Exporting from Design Tools}

            Describes how to export designs containing 2D and 3D assets into
            files that you can import to projects in \QDS.
        \li \l {User Interface}

            Describes the parts and basic features of \QDS.
        \li \l{Design Views}

            Describes the views and basic features of the Design mode.
            This is where you'll do most of your work.
        \li \l {Tutorials}

            Describes how to use \QDS to create a simple animated UI with some
            basic UI components, such as pages, buttons, and fields. Some of
            the buttons can be used for moving between the pages.
        \li \l {Qt Quick Best Practices}

            Describes how to create UIs that work efficiently on the intended
            platforms.
