    \title Exporting from Design Tools

    You need to use \QB to first export 2D assets from design tools and then to
    \l{Importing Designs}{import} them into \QDS.

    When working with 3D assets, you can use the export functions provided by
    the 3D graphics tools to save the assets in widely-used 3D graphics formats,
    and then use \QB to import them into \QDS.

    You can use the Qt Installer to install \QB if you have a commercial
    \QDS license. You can also purchase a \QB license separately from the
    \l{https://marketplace.qt.io/}{Qt Marketplace} and then install \QB using
    the Qt Installer.

    For best results when importing assets, follow
    the guidelines for creating and exporting them.

    \list

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Adobe Illustrator}

            You can either copy-paste your assets to Adobe Photoshop as
            \e {smart objects} or export them into file formats supported
             by \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Adobe Photoshop}

            You can use the \QBPS export tool in Adobe Photoshop to convert
            designs into \e {.metadata} format that you can import into
            projects in \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Sketch}

            You can use the \QBSK export tool in Sketch to convert designs into
            metadata that you can import into projects in \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Figma}

            You can use the \QBF export tool in Figma to convert designs into
            metadata that you can import into projects in \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting 3D Assets}

            You can import files you created using 3D graphics applications and
            stored in several widely-used formats, such as .blend, .dae, .fbx,
            .glb, .gltf, .obj, .uia, or .uip.
