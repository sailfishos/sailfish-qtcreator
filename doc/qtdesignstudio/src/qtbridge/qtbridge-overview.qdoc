    \title Exporting Artwork from Design Tools

    You need to use \QB to first export 2D assets from design tools and then
    import them. When working with 3D assets, you can use the export functions
    provided by the 3D graphics tools to save the assets in widely-used 3D
    graphics formats, and then use \QB to import them. You can download \QB
    from the \l{https://marketplace.qt.io/}{Qt Marketplace}.

    For best results when importing 3D assets, follow
    the guidelines for creating and exporting them.

    \list

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Adobe Photoshop}

            You can use the \QBPS export tool in Adobe Photoshop to convert
            artwork into Qt Quick files (.ui.qml) that you can import to
            projects in \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting Designs from Sketch}

            You can use the \QBSK export tool in Sketch to convert artwork into
            Qt Quick files that you can import to projects in \QDS.

        \li \l{Exporting 3D Assets}

            You can import files you created using 3D graphics applications and
            stored in several widely-used formats, such as .blend, .dae, .fbx,
            .glb, .gltf, .obj, .uia, or .uip.
