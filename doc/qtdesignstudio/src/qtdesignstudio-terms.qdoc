    \title Concepts and Terms

    This topic describes main \QDS concepts and terms.

    \section1 Component
    \target glossary-component

    An instantiable QML definition, typically contained in a .qml file.
    For example, a Button component may be defined in Button.qml. The
    QML runtime may instantiate this Button component to create Button
    objects. Alternatively, a component may be defined inside a
    \l{Component} QML type.

    \section1 Deploy Configuration
    \target glossary-deploy-config

    Handles the packaging and copying of the necessary files to a location
    you want to preview the UI at. The files can be copied to a location in
    the file system of the development PC or a \l{glossary-device}{device}.

    \section1 Device
    \target glossary-device

    An embedded device or an Anroid device.

    \section1 Kit
    \target glossary-buildandrun-kit

    \QDS groups run settings as kits to make cross-platform development easier.
    Each kit consists of a set of values that define one environment, such as a
    \l{glossary-device} {device} to preview the UI on.

    \section1 Mode
    \target glossary-mode

    Adapts the \QDS UI to the different UI design
    tasks at hand. Each mode has its own view that shows only the information
    required for performing a particular task, and provides only the most
    relevant features and functions related to it. As a result, the majority
    of the \QDS window area is always dedicated to the actual task.

    \section1 Project
    \target glossary-project

    Groups together a set of files, images, and other assets that you
    can deploy and run on different desktop and \l{glossary-device}{device}
    platforms, as specified by a \e {deploy configuration} and
    \e {run configuration}.

    \section1 Run Configuration
    \target glossary-run-config

    Starts the UI in the location where it was copied by the
    \e {deploy configuration}. By default, when you run a project, \QDS
    deploys it to the \l{glossary-device}{device} specified in the
    selected \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit}, and runs it there. However,
    if you have not made any changes to the project since you last deployed
    it, \QC simply runs it again.
