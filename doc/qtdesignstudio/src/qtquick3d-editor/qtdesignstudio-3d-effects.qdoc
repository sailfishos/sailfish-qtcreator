    \title Applying 3D Effects

    \QDS provides a set of Qt Quick 3D effects that inherit the types in the
    \l {Qt Quick 3D Effects QML Types}{Qt Quick 3D Effects} module.

    To apply a visual effect to a scene, drag-and-drop an effect from
    the \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D Effects} tab in \uicontrol Library to a
    \uicontrol {View 3D} object in \uicontrol Navigator. You can apply multiple
    effects to a scene. Select the \uicontrol {Scene Environment} component in
    \uicontrol Navigator to view the applied effects in \uicontrol Properties >
    \uicontrol {Scene Environment} > \uicontrol Effect. The effects are visible
    in the \uicontrol {Form Editor} view.

    See the following table for available effects and example images.

    For more information about creating your own effects, see
    \l {Creating Custom Effects and Materials}.

    \section1 Available Effects
    \table
    \header
        \li 3D Effect
        \li Example Image
        \li Description
    \row
        \li Additive Color Gradient
        \li \image effect-additive-color-gradient.png "Additive Color Gradient Effect"
        \li A gradient with additive color effect that adds a vertical
        gradient to the whole scene and then additively blends it with all other
        components in a 3D view. Additive blending adds the pixel values of
        the gradient and the 3D view, making the result lighter. White areas
        do not change, and black areas are the same color as the gradient.

        The \uicontrol {Top Color} and \uicontrol {Bottom Color} properties
        specify the colors used for the gradient at the top and bottom parts of
        the screen.

    \row
        \li Blur
        \li \image effect-blur.png "The Blur effect"
        \li A simple one-pass blur.

        The \uicontrol Amount property specifies the strength of the blur.

    \row
        \li Brush Strokes
        \li \image effect-brush-strokes.png "The Brush Strokes effect"
        \li A brush strokes noise effect that simulates an artistic painting of
        the image.

        The \uicontrol {Noise Sample Texture} property specifies the brush noise
        texture map as a \l Texture.

        The \uicontrol Length property specifies how far to offset the image
        with the brush.

        The \uicontrol Size property specifies the scale of the brush. Smaller
        values result in a finer brush.

        The \uicontrol Angle property specifies the angle to rotate the brush
        noise texture.

    \row
        \li Chromatic Aberration
        \li \image effect-chromatic-aberration.png "The Chromatic Aberration effect"
        \li A chromatic aberration effect.

        In real life, chromatic aberration is an optical phenomenon causing
        color fringes in high contrast areas. These color fringes are
        caused by different colors refracting at different angles splitting
        white light into a spectrum, which is referred to as dispersion.

        The \uicontrol {Mask Texture} property specifies a grayscale texture to
        control the position and the strength of the effect. The effect is
        strongest in white areas and weakest in black areas.

        The \uicontrol Amount property defines the amount of aberration.
        A negative value inverses the effect.

        Dispersion scales in relation to the distance from the value of
        the \uicontrol {Focus Depth} property.

    \row
        \li Color Master
        \li \image effect-color-master.png "The Color Master effect"
        \li A color adjustment effect.

        The \uicontrol {Red Strength}, \uicontrol {Green Strength} and
        \uicontrol {Blue Strength} properties can be used to adjust each color
        separately, and the \uicontrol Saturation property to adjust the
        strength of the overall saturation of the scene.

    \row
        \li Depth Of Field HQ Blur
        \li \image effect-depth-of-field-hq-blur.png "The Depth of Field HQ Blur effect"
        \li A depth-based blur effect that performs a gradient blur on regions
        of the image based on their deviation from a specified distance from the
        camera.

        The \uicontrol {Blur Amount} property defines the strength of blur when
        out of focus.

        The \uicontrol {Focus Distance} property specifies the distance from the
        camera where the content is in perfect focus.

        The \uicontrol {Focus Range} property specifies the distance around the
        \uicontrol {Focus Distance} where items are fully in focus. The focus
        then fades away to fully blurred by the same distance on both the near
        and far sides.

    \row
        \li Desaturate
        \li \image effect-desaturate.png "The Desaturate effect"
        \li A desaturating effect that decreases the intensity of all colors in
        the scene.

        The \uicontrol Amount property defines the amount of desaturation.

    \row
        \li Distortion Ripple
        \li \image effect-distortion-ripple.png "The Distortion Ripple effect"
        \li A distortion effect that adds circular ripples, moving away
        from the center of the effect.

        The \uicontrol Radius specifies the spread between ripples.

        The \uicontrol Width property specifies the width of a ripple, while
        \uicontrol Height defines the amount of distortion.

        The \uicontrol Phase property specifies the offset of each wave. Animate
        this property to see the waves move.

        The \uicontrol Center property defines the focus point of the
        distortion.

    \row
        \li Distortion Sphere
        \li \image effect-distortion-sphere.png "The Distortion Sphere effect"
        \li A distortion effect that creates a 3D effect of wrapping the
        scene around a spherical shape.

        The \uicontrol Radius property specifies the area of distortion, while
        \uicontrol Height defines the amount of distortion.

        The \uicontrol Center property defines the focus point of the
        distortion.

    \row
        \li Distortion Spiral
        \li \image effect-distortion-spiral.png "The Distortion Spiral effect"
        \li A distortion effect that creates a spiral-shaped distortion.

        The \uicontrol Radius property defines the area of distortion, while
        \uicontrol Strength defines the amount of distortion.

        The \uicontrol Center property defines the focus point of the
        distortion.

    \row
        \li Edge Detect
        \li \image effect-edge-detect.png "The Edge Detect effect"
        \li An edge highlighting effect that turns smooth, unchanging areas of
        the scene darker, while areas of the scene with sharp color changes are
        brightened to highlight the edges.

        The \uicontrol Strength property defines the strength of the edge
        highlighting.

    \row
        \li Emboss
        \li \image effect-emboss.png "The Emboss effect"
        \li An emboss effect that replaces each pixel either by a highlight or a
        shadow, depending on the light/dark boundaries on the scene.
        Low contrast areas are replaced by a gray background. The embossed
        result represents the rate of color change at each location.

        The \uicontrol Amount property defines the strength of the emboss
        effect.

    \row
        \li Flip
        \li \image effect-flip.png "The Flip effect"
        \li An effect that flips the whole scene either horizontally,
        vertically, or in both directions.

        The \uicontrol {Horizontal} and \uicontrol {Vertical} properties define
        the direction of the flip.

    \row
        \li Fxaa
        \li \image effect-fxaa.png "The Fxaa effect"
        \li A fast approximate anti-aliasing effect that removes some of the
        artifacts from the image without impacting performance as heavily as
        super-sampling would. The Fxaa effect is an easy fix for many aliasing
        problems. It also works with moving images. However, it should be noted
        that this effect can blur and distort fine text details, and as a
        screen-space heuristic technique, it can sometimes leave sharp edges
        that ideally would be anti-aliased.

    \row
        \li Gaussian Blur
        \li \image effect-gaussian-blur.png "The Gaussian Blur effect"
        \li A two-pass gaussian blur effect that blurs all objects in the scene
        evenly. To keep the effect performant, large blur amount produces a
        mosaic result instead of smooth blurriness.

        The \uicontrol Amount property defines the strength of the blur.

    \row
        \li HDR Bloom Tonemap
        \li \image effect-hdr-bloom-tonemap.png "The HDR Bloom Tonemap effect"
        \li A bloom with tonemapping effect that adjusts the gamma and exposure
        of the high-dynamic range rendered content to achieve the image quality
        you want. Also applies an adjustable bloom effect to very bright areas
        (like the sun glinting off a car).

        The \uicontrol Gamma property affects the non-linear curve of the
        lighting. Higher values increase the exposure of mid tones, brightening
        the image and decreasing the contrast.

        The \uicontrol Exposure property functions as a linear multiplier on the
        lighting, thus brightening or darkening the image overall.

        The \uicontrol {Blur Falloff} property adjusts the amount of bloom.
        Lower values result in stronger bloom effect, and higher values make the
        effect more subtle.

        The \uicontrol {Tonemapping Lerp} property defines the strength of the
        overall bloom effect. There is usually no need to adjust this.

        The bloom effect is applied to areas where the lighting is greater than
        the \uicontrol {Bloom Threshold} value. A value of \c{1.0} corresponds
        to white in the original render result. Lowering this value causes more
        areas of the rendered scene to bloom.

        The \uicontrol {Channel Threshold} defines the white point for the
        image. There is usually no need to adjust this.

    \row
        \li Motion Blur
        \li \image effect-motion-blur.png "The Motion Blur effect"
        \li A motion blur effect that creates an apparent streaking for rapidly
        moving objects in the scene.

        \note Only has a visible effect if the background of the scene is set to
        be transparent in the \uicontrol {Background Mode} field of the
        \uicontrol {Scene Environment} component. Otherwise, the clear color of
        the background hides the blur. For more information, see \l {Setting
        Scene Environment}.

        The \uicontrol {Fade Amount} property defines the fade speed of the
        trail.

        The \uicontrol Quality property can be adjusted to specify the quality
        of the blur. Increasing quality will have impact on performance.

    \row
        \li Scatter
        \li \image effect-scatter.png "The Scatter effect"
        \li A noise effect that scatters the pixels in a scene to create
        a blurry or smeared appearance. Without changing the color of each
        individual pixel, the effect redistributes the pixels randomly but in
        the same general area as their original positions.

        The \uicontrol {Noise Sample Texture} functions as the scatter noise
        texture map.

        The \uicontrol Amount property defines how much to scatter, while
        \uicontrol Direction sets the direction in which to scatter the pixels.
        Set to \c 0 for both horizontal and vertical, \c 1 for horizontal, and
        \c 2 for vertical.

        The \uicontrol Randomize property specifies whether scattering changes
        at each frame or not.

    \row
        \li S-Curve Tonemap
        \li \image effect-scurve-tonemap.png "The S-Curve Tonemap effect"
        \li A tonemapping effect that maps the colors in the scene to others to
        approximate the appearance of high-dynamic-range result.

        The \uicontrol {Shoulder Slope} property defines where highlights lose
        contrast.

        The \uicontrol {Shoulder Emphasis} property defines the amount of
        emphasis of the shoulder.

        The \uicontrol {Toe Slope} property defines where shadows lose contrast.

        The \uicontrol {Toe Emphasis} property defines the amount of emphasis
        of the toe.

        The \uicontrol {Contrast Boost} property enhances or reduces the overall
        contrast of the tonemap.

        The \uicontrol {Saturation Level} defines the overall saturation level
        of the tonemap.

        The \uicontrol Gamma property defines the gamma value of the tonemap.

        The \uicontrol {Use Exposure} property specifies whether the \uicontrol
        {White Point} value or the \uicontrol Exposure value will be used for
        luminance calculations.

        The \uicontrol {White Point} property defines the value for the white
        point.

        The \uicontrol Exposure property defines the value for exposure.

    \row
        \li Tilt Shift
        \li \image effect-tilt-shift.png "The Tilt Shift effect"
        \li A tilt shift blur effect that simulates depth of field in a simple
        and performant manner. Instead of blurring based on the depth buffer,
        it blurs everything except for a horizontal or vertical stripe on the
        layer.

        The \uicontrol {Focus Position} property specifies the placement of the
        focus bar in normalized coordinates.

        The \uicontrol {Focus Width} property defines a normalized range for
        Focus Position. Objects within this range will be in focus.

        The \uicontrol {Blur Amount} property defines the amount of blur.
        Amounts above 4 may cause artifacts.

        The \uicontrol Vertical property changes the direction of the effect
        from horizontal to vertical, while the \uicontrol Inverted property
        inverts the blur area, causing the center of the object to become
        blurred.

    \row
        \li Vignette
        \li \image effect-vignette.png "The Vignette effect"
        \li A vignette effect that reduces brightness towards the periphery of
        an object.

        The \uicontrol Strength property defines the strength of vignetting,
        while \uicontrol Radius specifies its size.

        The \uicontrol Color property defines the color used for the effect.
