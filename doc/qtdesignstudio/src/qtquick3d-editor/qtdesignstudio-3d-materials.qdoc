    \title Using 3D Materials

    \QDS provides a set of pregenerated Qt Quick 3D materials that can be used
    to create good-looking models quickly and easily.

    To apply a 3D material to a component, drag-and-drop a material from the
    \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D Materials} tab of \uicontrol Library to a model
    component in \uicontrol Navigator. The materials you add to the model are
    listed in the model component's \uicontrol Properties view.

    Each material has its own set of properties that can be used to further
    define the appearance of the material. For each material the \uicontrol
    {Environment Map} property specifies whether or not
    \l{Selecting the Mapping Method}{environment mapping} is used for
    specular reflection. Use the \uicontrol Texture property to select
    a texture for the environment map. The \uicontrol {Shadow Map} property
    determine whether or not shadow mapping is used for generating realistic
    shadows. You can also select a \uicontrol Texture for shadow mapping.

    \section1 Metal Materials

    The following describes properties of the metal-based materials, which
    include \uicontrol Aluminum, \uicontrol {Aluminum Anod Emis}, \uicontrol
    {Aluminum Anodized}, \uicontrol {Aluminum Brushed}, \uicontrol
    {Aluminum Emissive}, \uicontrol Copper, and \uicontrol
    {Steel Milled Concentric}.

    \section2 Color

    Set the surface tint of the material by specifying the
    \uicontrol {Metal Color} and \uicontrol {Base Color} properties. Use
    the \uicontrol {Emission Color} property to set the color of the glow for
    emissive materials. You can either use the color picker or specify an
    RBG value.

    \section2 Reflection

    Use the properties under the \uicontrol Reflection tab to specify the
    reflective qualities of the material. For more information on the various
    material properties related to reflection, see \l {Using Highlights and
    Reflections}.

    \list
        \target tiling_metal
        \li Use the \uicontrol {Map Offset} and \uicontrol {Map Scale}
            properties to define offset and scale for the reflection map. You
            can also define a texture for the reflection map by using the
            \uicontrol Texture property, and set a the tiling repeat for it
            by using the \uicontrol Tiling property.
        \li To further define the reflective qualities of the material,
            you can also set the \uicontrol Stretch and \uicontrol Texture
            properties of \uicontrol Reflection, or define a numerical
            value for \uicontrol Reflectivity.
        \li Set the \uicontrol {Fresnel Power} property to decrease head-on
            reflections (looking directly at the surface) while maintaining
            reflections seen at grazing angles.
        \endlist

    \section2 Roughness
    Use the \uicontrol Roughness properties to determine how light behaves when
    it comes in contact with material. With zero roughness, light bounces off a
    material, which makes it appear glossy. Increased roughness causes the light
    reflected off the material to scatter, which results in a matte appearance.

    \list
        \li The \uicontrol {Map Offset} \uicontrol {Map Scale} and \uicontrol
            Texture specify the quality of roughness applied to the material.
        \li Use the numerical \uicontrol Roughness property to define how
            glossy or matte the material appears.
    \endlist

    \target emission_metal
    \section2 Emission
    Use the properties under the \uicontrol Emission tab to specify the
    emissive qualities of the material. For more information on properties
    related to emission, see \l {Self-Illuminating Materials}.
    \list
        \li The \uicontrol Intensity property determines the quantity of light
            the surface of material emits.
        \li The \uicontrol {Map Texture} property defines a texture for
            emissive map, while the \uicontrol {Mask Texture} defines a
            texture for emissive mask. Use the \uicontrol {Mask Offset}
            to set the mask offset for the emissive map.
    \endlist

    \target bump_metal
    \section2 Bump
    Specify the properties under the \uicontrol Bump tab to simulate fine
    geometry displacement across the surface of the material. Use the
    \uicontrol Amount property to set the quantity of displacement, and
    the \uicontrol Texture property to define a texture for the bump map.
    For more information, see \l {Simulating Geometry Displacement}.

    \section2 Properties of the Steel Milled Concentric Material

    Another metal, the \uicontrol {Steel Milled Concentric} Material has
    certain properties that the other materials do not possess:

    \list
        \li The \uicontrol Anisotropy property stretches the highlight,
            which simulates minuscule scratches. You can also use a
            \uicontrol Texture property to define a texture for the anisotropy
            map.
        \li The \uicontrol {Index of Refraction} defines how much a ray of
            transmitted light is bent when it reaches the surface of the
            material.
    \endlist

    Under the \uicontrol Textures tab:

    \list
        \li The \uicontrol Tiling property to set the tiling repeat of the
            texture maps.
        \li Use the \uicontrol Diffuse property to set a texture for the
            diffuse map, and the \uicontrol Anisotropy property to set a
            texture for the anisotropy map.
    \endlist

    \section1 Glass Materials

    properties to set the color properties for glass-based materials.

    \target general_glass
    \section2 General

    \list

            behaves when it comes in contact with material. With zero roughness,
            light bounces off a material, which makes it appear glossy.
            Increased roughness causes the light reflected off the material to
            scatter, which results in a matte appearance.
        \li The \uicontrol Reflectivity property specifies how much light is
            reflected from the material.
        \li The \uicontrol {Index of Refraction} defines reflectivity by
            determinining how much a ray of transmitted light is bent when it
            reaches the surface of the material.
        \li The \uicontrol {Refract Depth} property sets the refraction depth
            for the material.

            map.
        \li The \uicontrol Coordinates property sets the bump coordinates of the
            refraction.
    \endlist

    For more information, see \l {Simulating Geometry Displacement}.

    \target rgm_glass
    \section2 Random Gradient Mapping

    For frosted glass materials, you can also specify \uicontrol
    {Random Gradient Maps} by using properties \uicontrol 1D, \uicontrol 2D,
    \uicontrol 3D and \uicontrol 4D. Each of the properties defines a texture
    map used to create the random bumpiness of the material.

    \section2 Band Light

    The outlook of the \uicontrol {Frosted Glass} material can be further
    defined by specifying the \uicontrol {Band Light} properties:
    \list
        \li The \uicontrol Fallof property sets the light intensity falloff
            rate.
        \li The \uicontrol Angle property sets the angle of the light source to
            which the band is perpendicular.
        \li You can also set the \uicontrol Brightness of the band light.
