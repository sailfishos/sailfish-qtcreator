    \title Exporting from Maya

    You can export graphics from Maya in the FBX format. The necessary plugin is
    usually enabled by default, but you can check that in the plugin manager.

    Maya exports the transformation as given by the scene. To include frozen
    transformations in your export, select \uicontrol Modify > \uicontrol
    {Freeze Transformation} in Maya before exporting your assets. For more
    information, see Maya documentation.

    We recommend using default pivot points in your designs to avoid problems
    when importing to \QDS. If you want to use a non-default position for a
    pivot point, you have to adjust it in Maya before exporting your assets.

    To export certain elements of your design, such as geometry, animations,
    and textures, you need to adjust the settings for FBX exports under
    \uicontrol {File Type Specific Options} in Maya export options. The
    optional steps should only be applied if required by the project. For
    example, including embedded media in your export simplifies moving the
    scene to another computer but increases the file size as well as the loading
    time of the scene since the textures need to be extracted before they can be
    imported to the scene. This would result in the same texture existing in
    three locations on your computer: the original location, embedded in the
    scene, and extracted into the asset import folder.

    These instructions apply to Autodesk Maya 2020.

    To export graphics from Maya:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol Window > \uicontrol Settings/Preferences >
            \uicontrol {Plug-in Manager} and check that the fbxmaya.mll
            plugin is enabled.
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {Export All}.

        \li In the \uicontrol {File name} field, enter a name for the export
            file.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Files of type} field, select
            \uicontrol {FBX export}.
        \li Select \uicontrol {File Type Specific Options} > \uicontrol Presets
            > \uicontrol {Current Preset} > \uicontrol {Autodesk Media &
            Entertainment} to select suitable default settings for importing to
            \QDS. These settings will be adjusted in the following steps, which
            will cause the \uicontrol {Current Preset} to change to \uicontrol
            {User defined}.
        \li Select \uicontrol Include > \uicontrol Geometry > \uicontrol
            {Convert NURBS surface to} > \uicontrol {Interactive Display Mesh}
            to convert NURBS surfaces to polygons based on the NURBS display
            settings.
        \li Optionally, select \uicontrol Animation > \uicontrol {Baked
            Animation}, and then select \uicontrol {Bake Animation} check box to
            include baked animations in your export. Enter the start and end
            frames to bake into your animation.

        \li Optionally, select \uicontrol {Embed Media}, and then select the
            \uicontrol {Embed Media} check box to include embedded textures.
            The embedded media will be copied to a \c fileName.fbm folder in
            the same location as the FBX file.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Export All} to export files.
