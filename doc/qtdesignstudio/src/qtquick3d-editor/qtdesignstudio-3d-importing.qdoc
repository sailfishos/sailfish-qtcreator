    \title Importing 3D Assets

    You can download \QB from the \l{https://marketplace.qt.io/}{Qt Marketplace}.
    It enables you to import files you created using 3D graphics applications
    and stored in several widely-used formats, such as .blend, .dae, .fbx, .glb,
    .gltf, .obj, .uia, or .uip. For a list of formats supported by each
    \l{Qt Quick 3D} version, see the module documentation.

    For more information about exporting 3D graphics, see
    \l{Exporting 3D Assets}.

    During the import, you can optimize the files for \QDS. You can remove
    components from meshes to reduce the cache size, find and fix issues in
    the files, optimize graphs and meshes, and so on. The available options
    depend on whether you are importing files that you created with Qt 3D Studio
    or with other 3D graphics tools. See the tooltips in the options dialog
    for more information about a particular option.

    To import 3D assets to \QDS projects:

    \list 1
        \li In the \l{Design Views}{Design mode}, select \l Library >
            \uicontrol Assets > \inlineimage plus.png
            .
        \li Select \uicontrol {3D Assets} in the dropdown menu to filter 3D
            graphics files.
        \li Select a file to import, and then select \uicontrol Open.
        \li In the \uicontrol {3D Scene Options} tab, select options for
            importing the file.
        \li Select \uicontrol Import to import the 3D graphics file.
        \li When the import is done, select \uicontrol Close.
    \endlist

    The 3D asset you added to the project now appears in \uicontrol Library >
    \uicontrol Components > \uicontrol {My 3D Components}. You can add it to
    your UI by dragging-and-dropping it to \l {3D Editor}.
