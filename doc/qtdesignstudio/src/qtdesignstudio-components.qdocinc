    \section2 Creating Custom Controls

    You can use project wizard templates to create stylable UI controls based
    on the components in the Qt Quick Controls module:

    \list
        \li \l Button
        \li \l {Check Box}
        \li \l {Slider and Dial}{Dial}
        \li \l {Slider and Dial}{Slider}
        \li \l {Spin Box}
        \li \l Switch
        \li \l [QtQuickControls2] {Pane}
        \li \l {Stack Layout}
        \li \l [QtQuickControls2] {SwipeView}{Swipe View}
    \endlist

    You can edit the properties of the controls in all the preset
    \l{Adding States}{states} to apply your own style to them.

    To create stylable UI controls:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol {Files and Classes} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Controls}.
        \li Select the control to create, and then select \uicontrol Choose.

            \note Components are listed in \l Library > \uicontrol Components >
            \uicontrol {My Components} only if the filename begins with a
            capital letter.
        \li Edit component properties in the \l Properties view.

            The available properties depend on the component type. You can
            \l{Specifying Dynamic Properties}{add properties for components} in
            \l {Connection View} > \uicontrol Properties.
    \endlist

    For an example of using the \uicontrol Button template to create a button
    and styling it, see \l{Creating a Push Button} in the \l{Log In UI - Part 1}
    tutorial.
