    \section2 Creating Custom Controls

    You can use project wizard templates to create a starting point for
    a custom \l Button, \l [QtQuickControls2] {Pane}, \l {Stack Layout},
    \l [QtQuickControls2] {SwipeView}{Swipe View}, or \l Switch.

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol {Files and Classes} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Controls}.
        \li Select the control to create, and then select \uicontrol Choose.

            \note Components are listed in the \uicontrol {My QML Components}
            tab of the \uicontrol Library only if the filename begins
            with a capital letter.
        \li Edit component properties in the \uicontrol Properties view.

            The available properties depend on the QML type. You can
            \l{Specifying Dynamic Properties}{add properties for components} in
            the \uicontrol Properties tab of the \uicontrol {Connection View}.
    \endlist

    For an example of using the \uicontrol Button template to create a button,
    see \l{Creating a Push Button} in the \l{Log In UI - Part 1} tutorial.
