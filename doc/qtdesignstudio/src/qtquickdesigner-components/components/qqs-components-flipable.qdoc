    \brief Provides a surface that can be flipped.

    A Flipable type can be visibly \e flipped between its front and back sides,
    like a card. The front and back sides are specified by using any two types
    inside the Flipable type. The type with the higher z-order is the front
    side. The \l opacityFront and \l opacityBack properties are used to hide
    and show either the front or back side of the flipable item at a time.

    The \l flipAngle property is used to animate the angle of the type to
    produce the flipping effect. The \l xAxis or \l yAxis property is set
    to 1 to determine which axis the type is rotated around.

    \section2 Example Usage

    You can use the Flipable component in \QDS to create a flipable item. In
    this example, the two sides of the flipable show ISO 7000 icons.

    The QML code looks as follows:

    \code
    FlipableItem {
        id: flipable
        width: 90
        height: 89
        opacityBack: 0

        IsoItem {
            id: arrowIsoIcon
            color: "#808080"
            anchors.fill: parent
            source: "./iso-icons/iso_grs_7000_4_0251.dat"
        }

        IsoItem {
            id: questionIsoIcon
            color: "#808080"
            anchors.fill: parent
            source: "./iso-icons/iso_grs_7000_4_0435.dat"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \qmlproperty Rotation Flipable::flipAngle

    The flip angle in degrees.

    The minimum value is -360 and the maximum value is 360 degrees.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Flipable::opacityBack

    The opacity of the back side of the flipable type.

    The opacity can be set between 0 and 1 to hide or show the items on the
    back side of the flipable type.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Flipable::opacityFront

    The opacity of the front side of the flipable type.

    The opacity can be set between 0 and 1 to hide or show the items on the
    front side of the flipable type.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int Flipable::xAxis

    Whether the type is rotated around the x-axis.

    This property is set to 1 to rotate the flipable type around the x-axis.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int Flipable::yAxis

    Whether the type is rotated around the y-axis.

    This property is set to 1 to rotate the flipable type around the y-axis.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Flipable::flipped

    Whether the flipable type has been flipped.

    This property is set to \c true when the type is flipped.
