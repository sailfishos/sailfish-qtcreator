    \title Qt Quick Studio Components

    The Qt Quick Studio Components module provides sets of components and
    effects enhanced for creating animated UIs. The components inherit
    \l {Qt Quick Shapes QML Types}. The effects inherit the types in the
    \l {Qt Graphical Effects} module. For more information about the effects,
    see \l{2D Effects}.

    \section1 Using Studio Components

    A set of ready-made studio components are available for creating differently
    shaped objects, such as arcs, pies, or triangles, as well as objects with
    particular abilities, such as being visibly \e flipped between their front
    and back sides, like a card. The studio components are built on top of
    \l {Qt Quick Shapes QML Types}, with some additional properties.

    The following table summarizes the available studio components and contains
    links to their documentation.
