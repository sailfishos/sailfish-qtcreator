    \title 2D Effects

    \QDS provides a set of Qt Quick Studio effects that inherit the types in the
    \l {Qt Graphical Effects} module. To apply a visual effect to a component,
    drag-and-drop it from \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol Effects to the
    component in \uicontrol Navigator.

    Effects have one or more source properties for specifying the visual input
    for which the effect is applied to an item. The altered visual output is
    then presented in the effect item itself. The source can be another, often
    hidden, item in the QML scene. More complex effects can have multiple
    sources. The source item type can be any QML type, even video or another
    effect. Pipelining multiple effects together is a simple way to create
    even more impressive output.

    Each effect has a set of properties that can be used to configure the effect
    output. Properties can be animated just like any other QML properties. The
    QML type documentation contains property descriptions and basic usage
    examples.

    In addition to the effects described in this topic, you can set linear,
    radial, and conical gradients. For more information, see
    \l{Picking Gradients}.

    \section1 Caching and Borders

    The \uicontrol Cached property allows the effect output pixels to be cached
    in order to improve the rendering performance. Every time the source or
    effect properties are changed, the pixels in the cache must be updated.
    Memory consumption is increased, because an extra buffer of memory is
    required for storing the effect output. We recommend that you disable the
    cache when the source or the effect properties are animated.

    The \uicontrol {Transparent border} property determines the blur behavior
    near the edges of the item, where the pixel blurring is affected by
    the pixels outside the source edges.

    If the property is set to \c true, the pixels outside the source are
    interpreted as being transparent, which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-border
    extension. The blur is expanded slightly outside the effect item area.

    If the property is set to \c false, the pixels outside the source are
    interpreted as containing the same color as the pixels at the edge of
    the item, which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-edge behavior. The blur
    does not expand outside the effect item area.

    \section1 Summary of 2D Effects

    The following table summarizes the available effects and contains links to
    the documentation of the inherited QML type.

    \note The effects are available when running with OpenGL.

    \table
    \header
        \li Icon
        \li Qt Quick Studio Effect
        \li Description
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/blend-mode-16px.png
        \li \l [QML] {Blend}
        \li Merges two source components by using a blend mode.

            The default \uicontrol Mode is \c subtract, where the pixel value
            from the component specified in the \uicontrol {Foreground source}
            field, which is going to be blended over the source component,
            is subtracted from the source and written over it.

            For a list of possible \uicontrol Mode values and examples of their
            use, see \l{Blend::mode}{Blend.mode}.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/brightness-contrast-16px.png
        \li \l {BrightnessContrast}{Brightness Contrast}
        \li Adjusts \uicontrol Brightness and \uicontrol Contrast.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/colourize-16px.png
        \li \l {ColorOverlay}{Color Overlay}
        \li Alters the colors of the source component by applying an
            \uicontrol {Overlay Color}. You can use the color picker
            to \l{Picking Colors}{select the color}.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/colourize-16px.png
        \li \l Colorize
        \li Sets the color in the HSL color space by specifying \uicontrol Hue,
            \uicontrol Lightness, and \uicontrol Saturation values.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/desaturation-16px.png
        \li \l {Desaturate}{Desaturation}
        \li Reduces the saturation of the colors by the value set in the
            \uicontrol Desaturation field. The value ranges from \c 0.0
            (no change) to \c 1.0 (desaturated). Desaturated pixel values are
            calculated as averages of the original RGB component values
            of the source item.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/directional-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {DirectionalBlur}{Directional Blur}
        \li Applies a blur effect to the specified direction. The value of the
            \uicontrol Angle field, defines the direction of the blur. This
            effect makes the source item appear to be moving in the direction of
            the blur. Blur is applied to both sides of each pixel, and therefore
            setting the direction to \c 0 and \c 180 provides the same result.

            The value of the \uicontrol Length field specifies the perceived
            amount of movement for each pixel. The movement is divided evenly
            to both sides of each pixel.

            The quality of the blur depends on the value of the
            \uicontrol Samples field. If the \uicontrol Length value is large,
            more samples are needed to preserve high visual quality.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/displace-16px.png
        \li \l Displace
        \li Moves the pixels of the source item according to the displacement
            map specified in the \uicontrol {Displacement source} field.

            The value of the \uicontrol Displacement field specifies the
            scale for the displacement. The larger the scale, the larger the
            displacement of the pixels. The value set to \c 0.0 causes no
            displacement. The value of \c -1.0 sets the inverted maximum shift
            according to the displacement source value, while \c 1.0 sets the
            maximum shift.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/drop-shadow-16px.png
        \li \l {DropShadow}{Drop Shadow}
        \li Generates a soft shadow behind the source component using a
            gaussian blur. This effect blurs the alpha channel of the input and
            colorizes the result, which it then places behind the source object
            to create a soft shadow. You can set the shadow's color in the
            \uicontrol {Drop Shadow Color} field and change its location in the
            \uicontrol {Horizontal offset} and \uicontrol {Vertical offset}
            fields.

            The value of the \uicontrol Radius field specifies the softness of
            the shadow. A larger radius causes the edges of the shadow to appear
            more blurry. The ideal blur is achieved by setting the value of the
            \uicontrol Samples field to twice as large as the highest required
            radius value plus one (\c {samples = 1 + radius * 2}).

            The soft shadow is created by blurring the image live using a
            gaussian blur, which is a costly operation. Fullscreen gaussian
            blur with even a moderate number of samples will only run at 60
            FPS on high-end graphics hardware.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/fast-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {FastBlur}{Fast Blur}
        \li Applies a fast blur effect to one or more source components.
            \uicontrol {Fast Blur} offers lower blur quality than
            \uicontrol {Gaussian Blur}, but it is faster to render.
            This effect softens the source content by blurring it with
            an algorithm that uses source content downscaling and
            bilinear filtering. Use this effect if the source content
            is rapidly changing and the highest possible blur quality
            is not needed.

            The value of the \uicontrol Radius field specifies the distance of
            the neighboring pixels that affect the blurring of an individual
            pixel. A larger radius increases the blur effect. The fast blur
            algorithm may internally reduce the accuracy of the radius in order
            to provide good rendering performance.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/gamma-adjust-16px.png
        \li \l [QML] {GammaAdjust}{Gamma Adjust}
        \li Alters the luminance of the source item. This effect is applied
            to each pixel according to the curve that is pre-defined as a
            power-law expression, where the value of the \uicontrol Gamma
            field is used as the reciprocal scaling exponent.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/gaussian-blur-16px.png
        \li \l [QML] {GaussianBlur}{Gaussian Blur}
        \li Applies a gaussian blur effect to one or more source components.
            The effect softens the image by blurring it with an algorithm that
            uses the gaussian function to calculate the effect. The effect
            produces higher quality than \uicontrol {Fast Blur}, but is slower
            to render. Performing blur live is a costly operation. Fullscreen
            gaussian blur with even a moderate number of \uicontrol Samples
            will only run at 60 FPS on high-end graphics hardware.

            The value of the \uicontrol Radius field specifies the distance of
            the neighboring pixels that affect the blurring of an individual
            pixel. The value of the \uicontrol Distance field is a parameter to
            the gaussian function that is used when calculating neighboring
            pixel weights for the blurring. A larger deviation causes an image
            to appear more blurry, but it also reduces the quality of the blur.
            A very large deviation value causes the effect to look a bit similar
            to what, for exmple, a box blur algorithm produces. A too small
            deviation value makes the effect insignificant for the pixels near
            the radius.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/glow-16px.png
        \li \l [QML] {Glow}
        \li Generates a halo-like glow around the source component. This effect
            blurs the alpha channel of the source and colorizes it with
            \uicontrol {Glow color}. It then places the alpha channel behind the
            source, resulting in a halo or glow around the object. The quality
            of the blurred edge can be controlled by using the values of the
            \uicontrol Samples and \uicontrol Radius and the strength of the
            glow can be changed using the value of the \uicontrol Spread field.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/hue-saturation-16px.png
        \li \l {HueSaturation}{Hue Saturation}
        \li Alters the source component colors in the HSL color space.
            This effect is similar to the \uicontrol Colorize effect, but
            the \uicontrol Hue and \uicontrol Saturation values are handled
            differently. This effect always shifts these values, as well as
            the \uicontrol Lightness value from the original, instead of
            setting them.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/inner-shadow-16px.png
        \li \l {InnerShadow}{Inner Shadow}
        \li Generates a colorized and blurred shadow inside the source using
            the color that you specify in the \uicontrol {Inner Shadow Color}
            field.

            The quality of the shadow can be controlled by the values of the
            \uicontrol Samples and \uicontrol Radius fields. Ideally, the
            sample value should be twice as large as the highest required
            radius value. For example, if the radius is animated between
            \c 0.0 and \c 4.0, samples should be set to \c 8.

            The value of the \uicontrol Spread field specifies how large a part
            of the shadow color is strengthened near the source edges.
            The effect produces a high quality shadow image, and therefore the
            rendering speed of the shadow might not be the highest possible.
            The rendering speed is reduced especially if the shadow edges are
            heavily softened. For use cases that require faster rendering speed
            at the cost of high visual quality, select the \uicontrol Fast
            check box.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/levels-16px.png
        \li \l {LevelAdjust}{Level Adjust}
        \li Adjusts color levels in the RGBA color space. This effect adjusts
            the source item colors separately for each color channel. Source
            item contrast can be adjusted and color balance altered.

            The value of the \uicontrol Gamma field specifies the change factor
            for how the value of each pixel color channel is altered according
            to the equation. Setting the gamma values under
            \c QtVector3d(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) makes the image darker, whereas the
            values above \c QtVector3d(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) lighten it. The value
            ranges from \c QtVector3d(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (darkest) to \c inf
            (lightest).

            You can specify the maximum and minimum input and output levels for
            each color channel. \uicontrol {Maximum input} sets the white-point,
            which means that all pixels with a higher value are rendered as
            white (per color channel). Decreasing this value lightens the light
            areas. To darken the light areas and to increase the contrast,
            decrease the value of the \uicontrol {Maximum output} field.

            The value of the \uicontrol {Minimum input} field sets the minimum
            input level for each color channel. It sets the black-point, which
            means that all pixels with a lower value are rendered as black
            (per color channel). Increasing this value darkens the dark areas.
            To lighten the dark areas and to reduce the contrast, increase the
            value of the \uicontrol {Minimum output} field.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/mask-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {MaskedBlur}{Masked Blur}
        \li Softens the image by blurring it. The intensity of the blur can be
            controlled for each pixel by specifying a \uicontrol {Mask source},
            so that some parts of the source are blurred more than others.

            The value of the \uicontrol Radius field specifies the distance of
            the neighboring pixels that affect the blurring of an individual
            pixel.

            The value of the \uicontrol Samples field specifies, how many
            samples are taken per pixel when blur calculation is done. Larger
            samples produce better quality, but are slower to render.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/opacity-mask-16px.png
        \li \l {OpacityMask}{Opacity Mask}
        \li Masks the source component with another component specified in the
            \uicontrol {Mask source} field. The mask item gets rendered into an
            intermediate pixel buffer and the alpha values from the result are
            used to determine the visibility of the source item's pixels in the
            display.

            Select the \uicontrol Invert check box to specify that the
            resulting opacity is the source alpha multiplied with the
            inverse of the mask alpha: \c {As * (1 - Am)}. When this property
            is \c false, the resulting opacity is the source alpha multiplied
            with the mask alpha: \c {As * Am}.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/radial-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {RadialBlur}{Radial Blur}
        \li Applies a directional blur effect in a circular direction around the
            component's center point. This effect makes the source item appear
            to be rotating into the direction of the blur. Other available
            motionblur effects are \uicontrol {Zoom Blur} and
            \uicontrol {Directional Blur}.

            The value of the \uicontrol Angle field specifies both the direction
            of the blur and the level of blurring. The larger the angle, the
            more blurred the result. The quality of the blur depends on the
            value or the \uicontrol Samples field. If the angle is large, more
            samples are needed to preserve high visual quality.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/recursive-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {RecursiveBlur}{Recursive Blur}
        \li Blurs repeatedly, providing a strong blur effect. This effect
            softens the image by blurring it with an algorithm that uses a
            recursive feedback loop to blur the source as many times as
            set in the \uicontrol Loops field.

            The value of the \uicontrol Radius field specifies the distance of
            the neighboring pixels that affect the blurring of an individual
            pixel.

            The effect may produce more blurred results than
            \uicontrol {Fast Blur} or \uicontrol {Gaussian Blur},
            but the result is produced asynchronously and takes more time.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/threshold-16px.png
        \li \l {ThresholdMask}{Threshold Mask}
        \li Masks the source item with another item specified by
            \uicontrol {Mask source}. The value of the \uicontrol Spread
            field determines the smoothness of the mask edges near the
            \uicontrol Threshold alpha value. Setting spread to \c 0.0 uses
            the mask with the specified threshold. Setting higher spread values
            softens the transition from the transparent mask pixels towards
            opaque mask pixels by adding interpolated values between them.
    \row
        \li \inlineimage icons/zoom-blur-16px.png
        \li \l {ZoomBlur}{Zoom Blur}
        \li Applies a directional blur effect towards source component's
            center point. This effect makes the source item appear to be
            moving towards the center point in Z-direction or the camera
            appear to be zooming rapidly.

            The value of the \uicontrol Length field specifies the maximum
            perceived amount of movement for each pixel. The amount is smaller
            near the center specified by the \uicontrol {Horizontal offset} and
            \uicontrol {Vertical offset} fields and reaches the specified value
            at the edges.

            The quality of the blur depends on the value of the
            \uicontrol Samples field. If the length value is large,
            more samples are needed to preserve high visual quality.

            Other available motion blur effects are
            \uicontrol {Directional Blur} and \uicontrol {Radial Blur}.
