    \title E-Bike Design
    \brief Illustrates how to use the timeline and states to animate transitions
    in an application.

    \image ebikedesign.png "Standard screen"

    \e {E-Bike Design} is a control center application for electric bikes.
    The application contains a Standard screen that displays a speedometer,
    a Trip screen that displays statistics about the current trip, and a
    Navigator screen that displays a map.

    The Trip and Navigator screens display a small animated speedometer that
    the users can select to move back to the Standard screen.

    \image ebikedesign-trip.png "Trip screen"

    In the \e {Screen01.ui.qml} file, we place the screens in a row in the
    following order from left to right: Trip, Standard, Navigator. We will
    use states to show the appropriate screen in the viewport, and the timeline
    to animate the transitions between and on the screens.

    \section1 Using Timelines to Animate Transitions

    We use the \uicontrol Timeline view to animate the transitions between
    the screens in \e {Screen01.ui.qml}.

    Our viewport contains 1000 frames, so we select the
    \inlineimage plus.png "Plus button"
    button to add a 5000-frame timeline to the root element.
    We use the default values for all other fields.

    To start recording the transitions between the Standard screen and the
    Trip and Navigator screens on the timeline, we select \e screenCanvas in
    the Design mode \uicontrol Navigator view. We check that the playhead is at
    frame 0, and then select the \inlineimage recordfill.png
    (\uicontrol {Auto Key (K)}) button (or press \key k).

    \image ebikedesign-timeline.png "Timeline view"

    At frame 0, we set the X coordinate to 0 in \uicontrol Properties >
    \uicontrol Geometry > \uicontrol Position to display the Trip screen.
    We then move the playhead to frame 1000 and set the X coordinate to
    -1286 to display the Standard screen. We continue by moving the playhead
    to frame 2000 and setting the X coordinate to -2560 to display the
    Navigator screen. At frame 3000, we set the X coordinate back to -1268
    to return to the Standard screen. Finally, at frame 4000, we set the X
    coordinate to -19 to return to the Trip screen.

    When we deselect the record button to stop recording the timeline, the
    new timeline appears in the view.

    When we select \e tripScreen in the \uicontrol Navigator, we can see the
    properties of the TripScreen QML type that we can animate in the
    \uicontrol Properties view.

    \image ebikedesign-trip-properties.png "Properties view of the Trip type"

    We set values for the \uicontrol Visibility,
    \uicontrol Opacity, \uicontrol currentFrame, and \uicontrol Scale properties
    to fade out the current screen when moving to another one and to make the
    speedometer grow and shrink in size depending on its current position.

    For more information about using the timeline, see \l {Creating Animations}.

    \section1 Using States to Move Between Screens

    We use the \uicontrol States view to determine the contents of the viewport.
    The animations are run in a particular state or when moving from one state
    to another.

    \image ebikedesign-states.png "States view"

    We create the states for displaying the Trip, Standard, and Navigation
    screens by moving from viewport to viewport in \e Screen01.ui.qml and
    selecting \uicontrol {Create New State} in the \uicontrol States view
    when the appropriate screen is displayed in the viewport.

    We then create states for animations that are run when moving between the
    screens: TripToStandard, StandardToNavigation, NavigationToStandard, and
    StandardToTrip.

    Finally, we create states for enlarging and shrinking the speedometer: Big,
    ToBig, and FromBig.

    We then return to the \uicontrol Timeline view and select
    \inlineimage animation.png "Timeline Settings button"
    to open the \uicontrol {Timeline Settings} dialog. We select
    the \uicontrol Add button to create animations for each part
    of the timeline. Therefore, the start and end frame of each
    animation are important, whereas their duration is not.

    \image ebikedesign-timeline-settings.png "Timeline Settings dialog"

    We set the start and end frames for the transitions to states to match the
    values of the X coordinate we set on the timeline.

    In the \uicontrol {Transitions to states} field, we select the state to
    switch to when the animation ends. In the lower part of the dialog, we
    bind the states that don't have animations to fixed frames.
