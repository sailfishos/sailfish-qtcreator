    \section1 Using Compilation Databases

    The \l{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html}
    {JSON compilation database format} specifies how to replay single builds
    independently of the build system.

    A \e {compilation database} is basically a list of files and the compiler
    flags that are used to compile the files. The database is used to feed the
    code model with the necessary information for correctly parsing the code
    when you open a file for editing.

    To generate a compilation database from the information that the code model
    has, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Generate Compilation Database}.

    You can use the experimental Compilation Database Project Manager to open
    the files in a compilation database with access to all the editing features
    provided by the Clang code model.

    To enable the plugin, select \uicontrol Help > \uicontrol {About Plugins} >
    \uicontrol {Build Systems} > \uicontrol {Compilation Database Project Manager}.
    Then restart \QC to load the plugin.
