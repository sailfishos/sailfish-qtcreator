    \title Managing Projects

    \image creator_managingprojects.png

    One of the major advantages of \QC is that it allows a team of designers and
    developers to share a project across different development platforms with a
    common tool for design, development, and debugging.

        \li \l{Creating Projects}

            To set up a project, you first have to decide what kind of an
            application you want to develop: do you want a user interface based
            on Qt Quick or Qt widgets. Second, you have to choose the
            language to implement the application logic: C++ or JavaScript.

        \li \l{Using Version Control Systems}

            The recommended way to set up a project is to use a version control
            system. Store and edit only project source files and configuration
            files. Do not store generated files.

        \li \l{Configuring Projects}

            Installation programs and project wizards create default
            configurations for \QC and your projects. You can modify
            the settings in the Projects mode.

        \li \l{Managing Sessions}

            Items such as open files, breakpoints, and evaluated expressions
            are stored in sessions. They are not considered to be part of
            the information shared across platforms.
