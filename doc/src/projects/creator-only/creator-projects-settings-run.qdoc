    \title Specifying Run Settings

    The run settings to specify depend on the type of the project and on the
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} that you build and run the project with.

    \QC automatically creates run configurations for your project.
    To view and modify them, select \uicontrol Projects >
    \uicontrol {Build & Run} > \uicontrol Run.

    The available run configurations are listed in the
    \uicontrol {Run configuration} field.
    To add run configurations for a project, select \uicontrol Add.
    To remove the current run configuration, select \uicontrol Remove.
    To rename the current run configuration, select \uicontrol Rename.

    To prevent \QC from automatically creating run configurations, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Build & Run},
    and then deselect the \uicontrol {Create suitable run configurations
    automatically} check box.

    The run configurations for qmake projects derive their executable from the
    parsed .pro files. For more information on how the commands are constructed,
    see \l{Starting External Processes}.

    \QC automatically adds run configurations for all targets specified in the
    CMake project file, \c {CMakeLists.txt}.

    \section1 Creating Run Configurations for Subprojects

    To prevent \QC from automatically creating run configurations for SUBDIRS
    projects, specify the following variable in the .pro file of the SUBDIRS
    project: \c {CONFIG += qtc_runnable}.

    \QC creates run configurations only for subprojects that also have
    \c {CONFIG += qtc_runnable} set in their .pro files.

    \include creator-projects-settings-run-desktop.qdocinc run settings desktop
    \include creator-projects-settings-run-analyze.qdocinc settings valgrind
    \include creator-projects-settings-run-debug.qdocinc run settings debugger
    \include creator-projects-settings-run-android.qdocinc run settings android
    \include creator-projects-settings-run-linux.qdocinc run settings linux
    \include creator-projects-settings-run-qnx.qdocinc run settings qnx
    \include linux-mobile/creator-projects-settings-run-b2qt.qdocinc run settings embedded

    \section1 Selecting the Run Environment

    \QC automatically selects the environment used for running the application
    based on the \l{glossary-device}{device} type. You can edit the environment
    or select another environment in the \uicontrol {Run Environment} section.

    You can edit existing environment variables or add, reset and unset new
    variables.

    When running on the desktop, the \uicontrol {Build Environment} is used by
    default, but you can also use the \uicontrol {System Environment} without the
    additions made to the build environment. For more information, see
    \l {Build Environment}.

    To run in a clean system environment, select \uicontrol {Clean Environment}.

    When running on a mobile device connected to the development host, \QC
    fetches information about the \uicontrol {Device Environment} from the device.
    Usually, it does not make sense to edit the device environment.

    To modify the environment variable values for the run environment, select
    \uicontrol {Batch Edit}. For more information, see \l{Batch Editing}.

    \section1 Specifying a Custom Executable to Run

    If you use CMake or the generic project type in \QC, or want
    to run a custom desktop executable, create a \uicontrol {Custom Executable}
    run configuration for your project. For example, when working on a library,
    you can run a test application that links against the library.

    Specify the executable to run, command line arguments, working directory,
    and environment variables to use.
