    \title Connecting iOS Devices

    You can connect iOS devices to a Mac computer with a USB cable to
    build and run applications on them from \QC.

    To be able to use \QC on \macos, you must install Xcode, and therefore,
    you already have the tool chain for building applications for iOS. \QC
    automatically detects the tool chain and creates the necessary
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for building and running applications on
    configured iOS devices.

    You only need Qt libraries that are built for iOS. You can install them as
    part of Qt 5.2, or later.

    \section1 Configuring Devices

    The connections between \QC and an iOS device are protected by using a
    certificate that you receive from Apple when you
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/}
    {enroll in the Apple Developer Program}. The certificate is copied to
    the device when you configure the device.

    The first time you connect the device to the Mac, you are asked to enable
    developer mode on the device. The next time you connect the device, \QC
    detects it automatically. To disable automatic connections to a device that
    you do not use for development, select \uicontrol Preferences >
    \uicontrol iOS, and deselect the \uicontrol {Ask about devices not in
    developer mode} check box.

    \note The process of configuring devices and the UI varies slightly
    depending on the Xcode version that you use. We recommend that you use the
    latest available Xcode version.

    To configure connections between \QC and an iOS device:

    \list 1

        \li Make sure that you have Xcode and Qt for iOS installed.

        \li Connect the device to the Mac computer with a USB cable.

        \li Start Xcode to configure the device.

            For example, in Xcode version 7.3.0, select \uicontrol Window >
            \uicontrol Device > \uicontrol + > \uicontrol {Add Device} to add
            the connected device.

        \li To specify build settings:

        \list 1

            \li Open a project for an application you want to develop for the
                device.

            \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run} to select
                the kit for building and running applications on iOS.

                \image qtcreator-ios-add-kit.png "Build & Run Settings"

        \endlist

        \li Select \uicontrol Run to specify run settings.

            Usually, you can use the default settings.

    When you run the project, \QC uses Xcode to deploy the application to the
    device.

    Your signing certificate is used to sign application packages for deployment
    to the device.

    \endlist

    \note If you cannot deploy applications, because a provisioning profile is
    missing, check that provisioning profiles are listed in Xcode by selecting
    \uicontrol Xcode > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol Accounts >
    \uicontrol {View Details}. For more information about how to acquire and
    install a provisioning profile, see Apple documentation.

    \section1 Viewing Device Connection Status

    When you connect an iOS device to a Mac computer with USB, \QC
    automatically detects the device if you have configured it by using Xcode.
    To view information about the connected device, select \uicontrol Preferences >
    \uicontrol Devices.

    \image qtcreator-ios-device-configurations.png "Devices dialog"

    If the current device state is \uicontrol Connected, (the traffic light icon is
    orange), you need to configure the device using Xcode.

    \section1 Testing on iOS Simulator

    If you do not have an iOS device or you do not want to create an account,
    you can test applications on
    \l{http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html}
    {iOS Simulator}, which is installed as part of Xcode. Each Xcode version
    simulates a predefined set of hardware devices and software versions.

    You can change the simulated hardware and software version in the run
    settings for the project. Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol Run, and then select
    the device to simulate in the \uicontrol {Device type} field.

    \QC uses the Xcode version set as current on the Mac computer.
    To check the version, enter the following command:

    \c {xcode-select --print-path}

    To change the version, enter the following command:

    \c {xcode-select --version}
