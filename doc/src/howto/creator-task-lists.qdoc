    \title Showing Task List Files in Issues Pane

    You can use code scanning and analysis tools to examine source code. These
    tools report issues for you to fix. \QC enables you to load lists of
    issues into the \uicontrol Issues pane for easier navigation.

    \QC expects tasks to be defined in a simple line-based file format that is
    easy to generate using scripts. The scripts can either convert reports from
    other tools or create lists of issues in the \l{Task List File Format}
    {task list format} from code. For an example of a script that checks new
    lines of code and matches them against regular expressions to generate a
    task list, see \c{scripts\mytasks.pl} in the \QC repository.

    \section1 Managing Task List Entries

    To open task list files in the \uicontrol Issues pane, choose \uicontrol File  >
    \uicontrol Open. Right-click a task list entry to open a context menu that
    contains commands for managing the entry. You can copy or remove task list
    entries or navigate to the corresponding source code.

    \QC monitors the loaded files and displays the changes in the \uicontrol Issues
    pane. To keep the current entries in a task list, but stop checking for
    changes, select \uicontrol {Stop Monitoring}.

    \section1 Task List File Format

    The filename extension must be .tasks for \QC to recognize a file as a
    task list file.

    Each line in a task list file is treated as a tab-separated list of strings
    with \c{\t}, \c{\n}, and \c{\\} used as escape characters. The strings are
    used to create one task per line. The lines can have one of the following
    formats:

    \list

        \li \c description

        \li \c{type\tdescription}

        \li \c{file\ttype\tdescription}

        \li \c{file\tline\ttype\tdescription}

    \endlist

    The task type can have one of the following values:

    \list

        \li A string starting with \c err, which displays the error icon in the
            beginning of the line

        \li A string starting with \c warn, which displays the warning icon

        \li Any other value, which sets the task type to Unknown and does not
            display an icon

    \endlist

    The values are not case sensitive.

    Lines starting with the hash mark character (#) in the first column are
    ignored.

    If the file path is given as a relative path, it is based on the parent
    directory of the task list file.
