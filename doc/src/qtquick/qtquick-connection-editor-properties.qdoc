    \title Specifying Dynamic Properties

    You can bind object properties to dynamic expressions to define global
    properties for an object that can be read by other objects. For example,
    you can specify global properties for the root object that you can use in
    the child objects.

    You can specify dynamic properties for objects in the
    \uicontrol Connections view.

    To specify dynamic properties for an object:

    \list 1
        \li In the \uicontrol {Connections} view, select the
            \uicontrol {Properties} tab.
        \li Select \uicontrol Item to select the object to specify the property
            for.
        \li Select \uicontrol Property to give a name to the property.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Property Type} to specify the type of the
            property.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Property Value} to specify the value of the
            property.
    \endlist
