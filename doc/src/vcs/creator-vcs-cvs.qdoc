    \title Using CVS

    CVS is an open source version control system.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Using Common Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol CVS > \uicontrol Edit to open a file for editing.

    To discard the changes that you made in a file, select \uicontrol Unedit.

    To specify the CVS root directory, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol CVS, and then
    specify the path to the directory in the \uicontrol {CVS root} field.

    You can specify settings for viewing diff output in the
    \uicontrol {Diff options} field.

    By default, you are prompted to confirm that you want to submit changes.
    To suppress the prompt, deselect the \uicontrol {Prompt on submit} check
    box.

    By default, all files that belong to the commit are annotated. To disable
    this feature, deselect the \uicontrol {Describe all files matching commit
    id} check box.
