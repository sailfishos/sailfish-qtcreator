    \title Using Perforce

    Perforce is a fast software configuration management system developed by
    Perforce Software.

    \section1 Configuring Perforce

    When you start \QC, it looks for the executable specified
    in the \uicontrol{P4 command} field in \uicontrol{Tools > Options > Version
    Control > Perforce}. If the file is not found, the following error
    message is displayed in the \uicontrol {Version Control} output pane:
    \uicontrol {Perforce: Unable to determine the repository: "p4.exe"
    terminated with exit code 1}. If you use Perforce, check that the
    path to the executable is specified correctly in the \uicontrol{P4 command}
    field.

    If you do not use Perforce, you can disable the Perforce plugin to
    get rid of the error message. Choose \uicontrol {Help > About Plugins} and
    deselect the \uicontrol Load check box for the \uicontrol Perforce plugin in
    the \uicontrol {Version Control} group.

    In the Perforce options, you can specify workspace details:
    \uicontrol {P4 user}, \uicontrol {P4 client}, and \uicontrol {P4 port}. To
    specify the details individually for several projects, use configuration
    files instead. Create a \c {p4config.txt} configuration file for each
    project in the top level project directory.

    \section1 Editing Files

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Using Common Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol {Edit File} to open a file for editing
    within the client workspace. By default, files are automatically opened for
    editing. To disable this feature, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Perforce,
    and then deselect the \uicontrol {Automatically open files when editing}
    check box.

    To list files that are open for editing, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol Opened.

    To group files for commit, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Perforce >
    \uicontrol {Pending Changes}.

    To view information about changelists and the files in them, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol Describe.

    By default, you are prompted to confirm that you want to submit changes.
    To suppress the prompt, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Perforce, and then deselect the
    \uicontrol {Prompt on submit} check box.
