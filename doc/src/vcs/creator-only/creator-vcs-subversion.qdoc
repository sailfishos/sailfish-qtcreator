    \title Using Subversion

    Subversion is an open source version control system.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Using Common Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Subversion > \uicontrol Describe to display commit log messages
    for a revision.

    By default, you are prompted to confirm that you want to submit changes.
    To suppress the prompt, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Subversion, and then deselect the
    \uicontrol {Prompt on submit} check box.

    To show whitespace changes in annotation views, deselect the
    \uicontrol {Ignore whitespace changes in annotation} check box.

    You can use Git as a client for a Subversion server. For more information,
    see \l{Using Git with Subversion}.
